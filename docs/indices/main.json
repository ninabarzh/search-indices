    "c": "Ubuntu 22.04 and apt-key deprecation by Ty Myrddin Published on May 12, 2022 After upgrading to Ubuntu 22.04 from 20.04 several repositories are disabled, and deprecation warnings on its signing keys are given. The apt-key deprecation message reads, \" Warning: apt-key is deprecated. Manage keyring files in trusted.gpg.d instead (see apt-key(8)) \", and \" Key is stored in legacy trusted.gpg keyring (/etc/apt/trusted.gpg), see the DEPRECATION section in apt-key(8) for details. \" Long story short, installing a key in the global keyring the way we used to mean that any packages signed by that key are trusted. The new [signed-by] option limits the damage when a repository's keys are compromised; the key cannot be used to forge packages unrelated to the repository itself and limits the damage done. New repositories need to be signed in a different way, and existing keys need to be exported to /usr/share/keyrings and the associated source.list files adapted to reflect that change. Below is a summarized version of applying the excellent instructions given by Debian and apt-key Is Deprecated. How To Add OpenPGP Repository Signing Keys Without It On Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Etc. for our setup in Ubuntu 22.04. Note that curl can be used instead of wget , and that key extensions can also be .pgp , .asc , .key , .whatever , as long as it is a key in a format apt supports. If a key is not ascii-armored, gpg will exit successfully without changing anything. If apt chokes on the resulting key, it is likely because the key is in another format like the newer binary \"keybox database\" format, which apt does not support. Adding keys the new way Checking whether a key is armored: $ wget https://example.com/key/repo-key.gpg $ file repo-key.gpg If the answer is repo-key.gpg: PGP public key block Public-Key (old) , then it is an armored key, but there is no harm in piping through --dearmor by default. Armored keys: $ wget -O- <https://example.com/key/repo-key.gpg> | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/<myrepository>-archive-keyring.gpg Non-armored keys: $ wget -O- <https://example.com/key/repo-key.gpg> | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/<myrepository-archive-keyring.gpg> Getting keys from a keyserver: $ sudo gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/<myrepository>-archive-keyring.gpg --keyserver <hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80> --recv-keys <fingerprint> All keys will be stored in the /usr/share/keyrings/ folder to be used in adding the repository with the signed-by option in a sources.list file. The sources.list files Each of the sources.list files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ is to contain a [signed-by] reference to its own key: deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/<myrepository>-archive-keyring.gpg] https://repository.example.com/debian/ stable main Example An example of adding the repository for helm , signing with its armored key, the old way: $ curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | sudo apt-key add - $ echo \"deb https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list And the new way: $ wget -O- https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/helm-archive-keyring.gpg [sudo] password for [user]: $ echo \"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/helm-archive-keyring.gpg] https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm.list Exporting existing signatures In order to be able to keep using the existing list of signatures and enable the disabled repositories again, it is necessary to export the individual keys to individual signature files. The below method also works for re-enabling repositories that use install scripts and do not have their signing keys listed on their sites, like for nordvpn and slack . Moving keys from /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d First move all existing keyring files in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ to the (newly created) /usr/local/share/keyrings/ directory as-is . /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d$ sudo mv repo-key.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/ Then, using an editor of choice, update all the corresponding .list files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d to have the [signed-by] field referencing its own key (as described above), and remove the hash that disabled the repository. Exporting keys from /etc/apt/trusted.gpg List all remaining keys: $ apt-key list Remove all expired keys to shrink the list: $ sudo apt-key del [last 8 digits] Export a useful key: $ apt-key export [last 8 digits]|sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/<myrepository>-archive-keyring.gpg Example exporting slack signing key in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg pub rsa4096 2014-01-13 [SCEA] [expired: 2019-01-12] 418A 7F2F B0E1 E6E7 EABF 6FE8 C2E7 3424 D590 97AB uid [ expired] packagecloud ops (production key) <ops@packagecloud.io> pub rsa4096 2016-02-18 [SCEA] DB08 5A08 CA13 B8AC B917 E0F6 D938 EC0D 0386 51BD uid [ unknown] https://packagecloud.io/slacktechnologies/slack (https://packagecloud.io/docs#gpg_signing) sub rsa4096 2016-02-18 [SEA] Remove the expired key: $ sudo apt-key del D59097AB Warning: apt-key is deprecated.

Your average witch is not, by nature, a social animal as far as other witches are concerned. There's a conflict of dominant personalities. There's a group of ringleaders without a ring.

Its buildings are of ancient stone, and contain many dark, winding corridors and small rooms, far more than the size of the grounds should allow. UU Wizards study magic for many years the hard way. Reading an uncountable number of books, passing hard tests, getting one (or several) of the many degrees available and practicing all day long makes a great wizard. Few faculty members like to teach. They have virtual lectures in a classroom, (Room 3b) that does not exist, a happy arrangement mutually understood and respected by Faculty and students alike. On Wizardry Works with your device Wizards like to use instruments specially made for the purposes of practicing magic.

Being invited in one of the orders, each wizard fights for the higher positions in the order, and fights off other wizards and other orders. Degrees The usual baccalaureates are Bachelor of Thaumatology (B.Thau), Bachelor of Magic (B.Mgc), Bachelor of Sortilege (B.S.), Bachelor of Magianism (B.Mn.), Bachelor of Divination (B.D.), and Bachelor of Civil Lore (B.C.L.).

Other degrees like Bachelor of Amulets and Talismans (B.Am.Ta.), Bachelor of Cabalistic Rites (B.C.R.) and Bachelor of Impractical Necromancy (B.Im.N.) do not lead to a Master's degree.

For those we settled on Codium.

    "c": "CommonJS to ESM by Ty Myrddin Updated on January 3, 2022 The react-base app was originally bootstrapped with Create React App using --template typescript . The available npm start , npm test and npm run build scripts work fine. But adding an index.js with a mix of commonJS and ES modules and doing an import of .json files, is a problem. Apparently modules are in transition but not all are ESM yet. We will hold our experimentations with such index.js files trying to use node-fetch and ngrok for now. We may come back to this later again. For now, we just used the Nginx on the droplet. Troubles Having added an index.js to the react-base project (node v16.13.1) for trying out ngrok : import env from './src/env/.env.json'; const handler = require(\"serve-handler\"); const http = require(\"http\"); const ngrok = require(\"ngrok\"); const fetch = require(\"node-fetch\"); ... running node index.js throws an error and trying to solve that we could be going around in circles. ES modules The implementation is now stable and can be used with the earlier commonJS module system. (Statement valid for version 13.14.0 and above). This means that files ending with .mjs or .js extensions (with the nearest package.json file with a field type) are treated as ES modules. First run $ node index.js (node:686975) Warning: To load an ES module, set \"type\": \"module\" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension. [snip] SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module Adding \"type: module\" to the package.json file enables ES6 modules. In ES6, the source code should use import syntax. Previous ES use require syntax. Sticking to ES5 We changed the import in the index.js to a require and it worked, but a lot of other files now give the same error. With type:module In the to the index.js nearest parent package.json file, we added a top-level \"type\" field with a value of \"module\": // package.json { [snip] \"type\": \"module\" [snip] } Problem solved, BUT, this gives another error message: TypeError [ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION]: Unknown file extension \".json\" for /react-base/src/env/.env.json Apparently, JSON module import is experimental ? It is supported only in commonJS mode, not in modules. Supposedly adding the flag —experimental-json-modules with node fixes this error and make commonJS and module mode works with .json file import. $ node --experimental-json-modules index.js Results in this error: file:///react-base/index.js:3 const handler = require(\"serve-handler\"); ^ ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and '/react-base/package.json' contains \"type\": \"module\". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension. Renaming index.js to index.cjs and $ node --experimental-json-modules index.cjs results in: SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module And we are back at the beginning. Rewriting imports The index.js tries to use both import and require module patterns, which isn’t possible. We either have to rewrite the \"require\" statements in index.js to \"imports\", like: import pkg from 'serve-handler'; const { handler } = pkg; But serve-handler , http , and ngrok are all commonJS modules, and doing this can lead to unexpected effects. We tried, just for the heck of it. So we undo the \"type\": \"module\", in package.json and rewrite the import env from './src/env/.env.json'; to a commonJS require: const env = require('./src/env/.env.json'); : $ node index.js /react-base/index.js:5 const fetch = require(\"node-fetch\"); ^ Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /react-base/node_modules/node-fetch/src/index.js from /react-base/index.js not supported. Instead change the require of /react-base/node_modules/node-fetch/src/index.js in /react-base/index.js to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules. node-fetch And the next problem appears: node-fetch was converted to be an ESM only package in version 3.0.0-beta.10 . It is now an ESM-only module and can not be imported with require. the async import() function from CommonJS to load node-fetch asynchronously: const fetch = (...args) => import('node-fetch').then(({default: fetch}) => fetch(...args)); Or downgrade to node-fetch version 2.6.6, which is built with CommonJS. <= For now WHERE'S MY COW?!

    "c": "Legitimisation patterns by Ty Myrddin Published on October 13, 2020 Legitimate power is based on a structural relationship (or rather the acceptance of economic stratification or other forms of hierarchy) between the influencing agent and the target. Implicitly, or explicitly, the agent says, “I have a right (the position) to ask you to do this and you have an obligation (the position) to comply”. When words like “obliged” or “obligated”, “should”, “ought to”, “must”, and “are required to” are used, they may signal an attempt at “legitimisation of power” (which even if accepted by a society, may not be considered lawful in more common sense perceptions or by a questioning individual). Legitimacy can be understood as a capital of recognition (Bourdieu). This symbolic capital makes a coercive force be accepted for whom it “suffers”. Power becomes authority when it possesses “capital of legitimisation”. However, bearing in mind that throughout political history of the West that capital of legitimacy has function and has been stated in diverse ways, this distinction between power and authority must take in the multiple and diverse forms in which both have been conceived. There are mainly three legitimacy paradigms that can synthesize the earlier mentioned history: the paradigm of difference, that of equality, and that of interdependency between difference and equality. Each one of these paradigms entails different ways of conceiving the legitimate power and the illegitimate power: within difference the legitimate power is the sacred force owned by the sovereign over the subordinate who lacks power (since the illegitimate power lacks formulation it can only be conceived as a resistant practice). within equality the legitimate power is the determination of the collection of equals (system, nation, society, …) over oneself, it is the self-created or emerging domain from a systemic collection of relations, while the illegitimate and subjective power splits up, fragments or scatters the whole, and at the same time progresses producing “illegitimacy”. within interdependence the power assimilates the tension between potential (possibility) and force in action, all power and all authority is conceived as disintegrating and subjective, a degree of recognition between different ones who do not give up difference and who recognize themselves on it as equally strongly linked in interdependency webs where the possibility of better balanced relationships appears.

    "c": "Scenario logics by Ty Myrddin Published on April 26, 2022, From a scenario planning done in 2013, with some of the measurables and observables that had appeared by 2022: Obliviousness and congruence Plot In scenario planning everything is a prediction. None of it is real. All predictions are wrong. And that which gets overlooked in most (if not all) digital scenarios is reality. For example: We belong to a finite planet, with finite resources. Likely effects Constraints on economic development (but not for transnational players in the neoliberal network). Corporations and businesses already show a trend of making employees make do with what they have and requests made by employees for better resources (to serve customers with) are ignored, leaving employees in a very difficult place – unable to do their job properly and on top of that, likely to be penalised for ‘poor performance’. This could lead to people feeling burned out and frustrated. Performance will drop as a result and so will demand and profits. Instead of dealing with it (just as with addicts facing a scarcity of the resource they are dependent on), over-use of resources, such as the depletion of rain forests and over-fishing can occur. Opportunism can increase. Misuse of scarce resources is also likely. The effect of inflation tends to be stronger for low-income individuals, whom inflation renders relatively more vulnerable, thereby increasing inequality. Lack of material resources - chronic (low income) and situational (inflation) lack of material resources - causes people to make harsher moral judgments and be more (often) physically ill. Measurables and observables Many of the metals needed to feed the surging global demand for high-tech products, from smartphones to solar panels, cannot be replaced, according to a Yale study, On the materials basis of modern society The British Geological Survey (BGS) Risk List states that economically important metals with high levels of risk to supply disruption including antimony (with application as a fire retardant), bismuth (used in numerous medical applications), platinum group metals (active components in auto-catalysts), and tungsten (a key hard metal used in most cutting tools), particularly the rare earth elements and antimony, have low recycling rates and a limited number of substitutes. They are also almost exclusively mined as by-product metals. The minimum total power that was required to run (wall socket power) and maintain (embody) the internet in 2017 was guesstimated to be somewhere between ~131 GW + ~167 GW = ~298 GW and ~204 GW + ~288 GW = ~492 GW. Surveillance society Plot A government steps in to protect its citizens from (potential) dissident and/or criminal actions and/or information that might “corrupt” its citizens. (Intelligence) Agencies use data-mining to identify (potential) individual dissidents and criminals. Government steps in to protect its individual citizens’ privacy from being mined by non-state-actors and to create distraction from their own mining activities. Strong privacy regulations emerge. Citizens are increasingly being targeted in surveillance with surveillance tools purchased from China. Likely effects Organisations (Cartels, corporations, companies, NGO’s) are restricted in their use of data. Consumerism is stifled. Governments will try to shift responsibility to individual citizens. Identity theft and ransomware boom. Individual citizens and citizen groups supported by NGO’s call for “making the internet more safe (for children/women/dissidents)”. Governments try to regulate again and surveillance increases. Companies offering private and protected access to online services and make a lot of money. Mobile devices are closed and curated. Because people need to appear perfect to others, the need to appear perfect to oneself increases also (the cognitive dissonance is too painful). Acknowledging mistakes and failures and the feelings associated with them can be hard. The surveillance society makes people have “negative emotions”. The positive thinking movement encourages people to ignore their negative emotions. Negative emotions get buried in subconscious, resulting in mood swings, unexplained sadness, and mild depression, and eventually in aggression. Suppressing negative emotions may lead to depression, low self-esteem, and even physical illness in extreme cases. Suppressing emotions is a risk factor in premature death, including death from cancer. Negative emotions are dumped elsewhere on innocent people. NGO’s will need more funding to respond with new/more support for women and children (at home) and dissidents (elsewhere). Consciously constantly suppressing emotions can cause emotional numbness. It is common to hear the phrases “We live in stressful times” and “It is what it is” (with a shrug) and “You shouldn’t feel this way. Everything is alright. You need to be positive.” Measurables and observables The attack patterns may or may not have to do with psychogenic forces and deep states and include women and children more targeted more by teensy weensy petty tyrants, little petty tyrants and minor petty tyrants. human rights activists, journalists, land defenders, and political dissidents targeted more by petty tyrants. identity theft and ransomware attacks happening via automated botnets. (Intelligence) Agencies increasingly using data-mining or bying data from brokers to identify “(potential) individual dissidents and criminals”. The old EU Data Protection Directive of 1995 was outdated. It failed to cover for example, social networking sites, cloud computing, location-based services, smart cards and biometric data, and in 2012 the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the EU’s data protection rules to strengthen privacy rights and boost Europe’s digital economy. Unlike directives, the new GDPR that came into force in 2018 does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation. It is directly binding and applicable. Note that the GDPR only addresses privacy concerns related to data processing by private sector and not by individual Member States. With the internet being a global network (driven by established interests), laws regarding for example, digital fingerprinting by intelligence agencies, may develop completely differently from one country to another regardless of raised concerns at the EU level as to the compatibility of such activities with human rights standards. Interventions by governments Plot Corporations, enterprises and NGO’s are targets in this scenario. A government attempts to regulate the situation in order to protect the targets and itself. All infrastructure becomes critical. The targets are held responsible. Attacks are perceived as cyber war events. Cyber warfare breaks out. Likely effects Increased cost (capital) for businesses/organisations online. Increasingly business resources are focused on compliance with regulation instead of risk assessments for gaining a profit. Botnets get taken down. More cyber criminals are caught. Opportunity cost for private petty tyrants increases. Measurables and observables The attack patterns that the (in)famous Equifax (and other) data breaches reveal, is one of negligence - only self, no real concern for customers/clients/citizens and the context of the internet. This invites government regulation while such vulnerable products do not invite perceptions of sophisticated hacking on infrastructure by other nations and acts of cyberwar that call for counterattacks. On the contrary. The JP Morgan Chase hack is a prime example of immediately perceiving cyberwar after a breach is made known. When discovered in 2014, the media were full of articles on Russian hackers attacking the U.S. financial system in retaliation against U.S. government-sponsored sanctions aimed at Russia. As it turns out in 2015, it was a “worldwide hacking ring” with four members, of which one was an American and two were Israeli’s....",

    "c": "The European Union must keep funding free software by Ty Myrddin Published on July 22, 2024 Original: https://pad.public.cat/lettre-NCP-NGI , initially published by petites singularites , English translation provided by OW2 . If you want to sign the letter, please publish the letter on your website and complete the table below on this page . Open Letter to the European Commission Since 2020, Next Generation Internet (NGI) programmes, part of European Commission's Horizon programme, fund free software in Europe using a cascade funding mechanism (see for example NLnet’s calls). This year, according to the Horizon Europe working draft detailing funding programmes for 2025, we notice that Next Generation Internet is not mentioned any more as part of Cluster 4. NGI programmes have shown their strength and importance to supporting the European software infrastructure, as a generic funding instrument to fund digital commons and ensure their long-term sustainability. We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover when NGI has proven efficient and economical to support free software as a whole, from the smallest to the most established initiatives. This ecosystem diversity backs the strength of European technological innovation, and maintaining the NGI initiative to provide structural support to software projects at the heart of worldwide innovation is key to enforce the sovereignty of a European infrastructure. Contrary to common perception, technical innovations often originate from European rather than North American programming communities, and are mostly initiated by small-scaled organisations. Previous Cluster 4 allocated 27 million euros to: “Human centric Internet aligned with values and principles commonly shared in Europe” ; “A flourishing internet, based on common building blocks created within NGI, that enables better control of our digital life” ; “A structured ecosystem of talented contributors driving the creation of new internet commons and the evolution of existing internet commons”. In the name of these challenges, more than 500 projects received NGI funding in the first 5 years, backed by 18 organisations managing these European funding consortia. NGI contributes to a vast ecosystem, as most of its budget is allocated to fund third parties by the means of open calls, to structure commons that cover the whole Internet scope - from hardware to application, operating systems, digital identities or data traffic supervision. This third-party funding is not renewed in the current program, leaving many projects short on resources for research and innovation in Europe. Moreover, NGI allows exchanges and collaborations across all the Euro zone countries as well as “widening countries”, currently both a success and an ongoing progress, likewise the Erasmus programme before us. NGI also contributes to opening and supporting longer relationships than strict project funding does. It encourages implementing projects funded as pilots, backing collaboration, identification and reuse of common elements across projects, interoperability in identification systems and beyond, and setting up development models that mix diverse scales and types of European funding schemes. While the USA, China or Russia deploy huge public and private resources to develop software and infrastructure that massively capture private consumer data, the EU can’t afford this renunciation. Free and open source software, as supported by NGI since 2020, is by design the opposite of potential vectors for foreign interference. It lets us keep our data local and favors a community-wide economy and know-how, while allowing an international collaboration. This is all the more essential in the current geopolitical context: the challenge of technological sovereignty is central, and free software allows to address it while acting for peace and sovereignty in the digital world as a whole. In this perspective, we urge you to claim for preserving the NGI programme as part of the 2025 funding programme.

    "c": "Time to choose a new password? by Ty Myrddin Published on February 24, 2023 Image credit: Xkcd Currently perceived state Maintaining security demands ever longer, complex passwords with frequent changes, now augmented by installing and using multifactor authentication (MFA), with all passwords encrypted in transit and either encrypted or hashed at rest, and further augmented with biometrics. And we're all using it to protect our PII. Really? The elephant in the room In 2019, Microsoft found 44 million of its users had used the same password on more than one account. According to a 2019 Google study , almost two-thirds of people use the same password across multiple accounts. And apparently, IT professionals reuse passwords more than average users. They have, of course, more accounts to log into than the average user. The most popular passwords are extremely easy to guess. A lot of people use their name or birthdate in their password. The 2019 HYPR study revealed that lots of people rely on memory to manage their work passwords. Also, in 2020, according to The Ponemon State of Password and Authentication Security Behaviors Report , a little less than half of organisations still rely on sticky notes for password management. And share their password with someone else, even their email account password. In the HYPR 2022 report , 80% of reported breaches are due to authentication weaknesses, yet 90% believe their authentication approach is secure, and 63% kept their insecure authentication methods after a breach. More than half of users would prefer an alternative method to passwords. People are frustrated with passwords and just wish for the simplest access possible, instead of having to carry a cognitive burden, and having to jump through hoops all the time to keep their PII safe and secure. Future developments All passwords and passphrases will be obsolete. This is not unlikely to happen: The increase in affordable computing power provided by the cloud is not only providing companies application resources, but also providing adversaries with more password-cracking resources. Meanwhile, users continue to choose weak passwords, and as a result, there is a strong push to support alternative identification and authentication mechanisms . Mechanisms going beyond something one knows (password) and/or something one possesses (phone, fob) and/or even what one is (fingerprint, retinal print). Maybe we'll be using who one is, in the form of episodic memory because who are we but the stories we tell (ourselves), or in the form of our thoughts , because \"I think therefor I am\" ...

    "c": "Cracked: Surveillance architecture by Ty Myrddin Published on November 02, 2019 To put it bluntly, metadata is hidden data that can fuck you over. Fuck you over real hard and rough like, savvy? Often defined as “data about data,” metadata is information about a specific file that’s often included within the file itself but that’s often not readily visible or modifiable to the end-user when z is viewing the file in the standard application that z would typically use to view the file. In other words, metadata provides background information about a file. Chances are that every document you create, every digital photograph you take, every music file you download, and so on, all have little bits of metadata which can leak vital information about your identity. ~ The dangers of metadata, 2008 Surveillance and censorship go hand in hand, what else would surveillance be for other than to keep subjects obedient. Surveillance is carried out by just about everybody, parents, teachers, neighbours, organised private groups, corporations and governments, and we are not helpless, we can avoid surveillance as best as we can. Likewise, censorship can be carried out by everybody as well. And we can try to circumvent censorship as long as we also protect ourselves from prying eyes on what we are doing.

    "c": "General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by Ty Myrddin Published on April 15, 2018 The old Data Protection Directive of 1995 was outdated. It failed to cover for example, social networking sites, cloud computing, location-based services, smart cards and biometric data, and in 2012 the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the EU’s data protection rules to strengthen privacy rights and boost Europe’s digital economy. Unlike directives, the GDPR does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation. It is directly binding and applicable. All seven principles governing the OECD’s recommendations for protection of personal data are incorporated into the new EU regulation. Personal data Article 4(1) defines “personal data” as follows: ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person; This definition is broad and fairly all-encompassing. It includes any information relating to an identified individual (which makes such information personal to that individual), or any information relating to someone who could be identified based on a variety of identifiers. Controllers and processors Article 4 defines data controllers and data processors as follows: (7) ‘controller’ means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law; and (8) ‘processor’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller; Lawfulness of processing conditions Data processing must be “lawful”, meaning it must be justified by a legitimate purpose in order to be permissible. For “legitimate interests” the interests that are important to a business or organisation are not enough. These conditions must include Consent of the data subject Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject or to take steps to enter into a contract Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of a data subject or another person Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller Necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests, rights or freedoms of the data subject. Note that this condition is not available to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. Biometric data It defines biometric data as special categories of personal data and prohibits its processing, thereby protecting people from having their information shared with third parties without their consent. Biometric data are: _“personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allows or confirms the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data”. _ Conditions for processing special categories of data Processing of special categories of data for the purpose of \"uniquely identifying a natural person\" is prohibited, but it contains some exceptions. Explicit consent of the data subject, unless reliance on consent is prohibited by EU or Member State law Processing is necessary for carrying out obligations under employment, social security or social protection law, or a collective agreement Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of a data subject or another individual where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent Processing carried out by a not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim provided the processing relates only to members or former members (or those who have regular contact with it in connection with those purposes) and provided there is no disclosure to a third party without consent Processing relates to personal data manifestly made public by the data subject Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or where courts are acting in their judicial capacity Processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of Union or Member State law which is proportionate to the aim pursued and which contains appropriate safeguards Processing is necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine, for assessing the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or a contract with a health professional Processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of healthcare and of medicinal products or medical devices Processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, or scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes The right to be forgotten The Regulation states that consent must be explicit before the collection of the data. As in, users must be opted-out by default and be provided with an opt-in, instead of default be opted-in (often without their knowledge) and then have to search for an opt-out. Also, “the data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time”.​ Data breaches must be notified within 72 hours If a company or organisation discovers a data breach, then processors must inform the authorities within 72 hours of discovery. Companies managing biometric information can be hit with penalties if they do not make efforts to secure that data. Big penalties. Data protection by design and by default The Article 25 Data Protection by Design (DPbD) seeks to embed privacy protection at every level from conception to deployment. DPbD is not only about technological design. It extends to IT systems, accountable business practices, and physical design and networked infrastructure. This integrated approach is “an important factor in avoiding falling into techno-centric solutions to a sociotechnical problem.” In usual engineering practice, legal issues are considered obstacles to be overcome after a novel IT solution has been built and is to be rolled out. DPbD uses a reversed approach, whereby systems and processes are conceived and developed with privacy protection at their core. Legitimate interest Under the old directive that aimed to regulate data correlation, not just data collection, it was illegal to process personal data without a “legitimate interest”, and that legal basis was unavailable to data brokers (Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests of the data controller under Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC). Now, Recital 47 - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - Overriding legitimate interest* states: ”[t]he processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest“ . Can the data industry rely on legitimate interests or is it required to obtain consent despite the absence of a relationship with the data subjects? Under the GDPR, the legal basis for...",

A circular prison with a single guard tower in the middle was the original blueprint for the structure. It seems we have created some heterarchical form of panopticon on the internet, where just about everybody is spying on everybody else from behind sunglasses and masks. In particular big data corporations and nation states seem very busy with that, in very organised and automated ways. Hack-all-around-you, surveillance, and de-anonymisation seem to have become common practice (and competition). Machine learning (ML) is a key component in technologies such as predictive analytics and artificial intelligence. The Computer seems to be running the show. Most of the current AI offerings on the market can identify associations in large quantities of data, but can not work out complex phenomena of cause and effect or identify modifiable factors that can engender desired outcomes. Yet. I don’t know what is more dangerous, a world run by Black Rock ’s Aladdin -like machines as if they can, or development of machines that actually can and then making ourselves dependent on these even more. ML is used to review large volumes of data and identify patterns and trends. An error, for example a faulty sensor generating a flawed data set, can cause rippling effects within a machine learning interface, because events after the error may be flawed, skewed or just plain undesirable. Errors do occur, and it is a susceptibility that developers have thus far been unable to premeditate and negate consistently. Imagine, if people were to rely on these patterns and trends?!?

    "c": "Pave the way for distributed clouds on premises by Ty Myrddin Published on November 07, 2024 Steampunk airship fleet by Greg Hildebrandt, Vladimir Kush, Gediminas Pranckevicius, Erik Johansson, and Peter Mohrbacher Current trends Virtualisation solutions and moving data, computational, and software capabilities to the cloud drives for example, cloud-native and serverless applications. Its adoption signifies that centralisation of software and hardware resources in the hyperscale data centres allows for energy aware storage solutions like using Solid-State Drives for data needing high transfer speeds and long-term backup storage solutions for the rest of the data . Data centres can also use solar and wind farms , which is less likely an option for smaller organisations. Detection and shutdown of idle servers can also easily be done centrally to save energy. Most of all, the cloud enables use on demand of resources and geolocation for bringing a service near its end-points now. Development of Integrated infrastructures concerns dedicated sustainable hardware for software development, and includes domain specific hardware. Near future Edge computing is a distributed model that brings some computational tasks and data storage closer to the user (as source of data and as consumer). It can range from static mini-clouds on premises to flexible follow-the-need services via onboard computing and distributed networks of computational nodes. Originally developed with IoT applications in mind, mini-clouds on premises can be perceived as an intermediate step towards a completely distributed paradigm following and supporting the ongoing trend in decentralised energy production and smart energy grids. This then can allow for better profiling of energy consumption patterns and data usage patterns. AI computational tasks are very energy greedy. Trends such as federated learning algorithms, data compression of curated data, and approximate computing help reduce energy consumption, and perhaps there will be data-centric green AI techniques . Especially worth mentioning is sustainability-aware self-adaptation , using decision maps. What all three need is further research, academic and industrial eduction, additional learning paths, and most of all, an attitude towards responsibility for sustainable solutions created by design. Designs will likely first focus on reuse and hardware lifecycle management for creating longer lasting and better maintainable hardware, at a trade-off for being able to adopt new types of hardware when they become available. The far future? High power usage in computing caused by the von Neumann bottleneck is a significant sustainability issue, and Non-von Neumann architectures promise solutions for sustainable and energy-efficient nodes, especially at the edge layer. Photonic integrated circuits have already enabled fast artificial neural networks. Photonics can perhaps piggy-back on distributed paradigms. Problems Awareness creation requires monitoring and communicating environmental impacts and a behavioural change in data consumption patterns, and is a big problem because there is not enough digital spine (yet) . Real progress requires shared responsibility and accountability by all involved in all value chains. A very big ask. Unclear use, business, and communal cases and little activating legislation like dynamic pricing on real-time energy demands, make such changes very hard. Especially unclear are the effects on provision quality, energy savings, and the developments in the evolution of technology ecosystems, for example for federated mini-clouds on premises. A spine could help. These issues are complex and are thought to need to be solved on an international level first. This can take decades, if it happens at all. People don't like change. Really? People LOVE change, IF coming in the right proportion, at the right time and in the right way. If a proposed change is not being implemented, then the problem is with the change and not with people. Apparently there are not enough champions that have the decision power and budget to take the initiative and steer towards sustainability. There seems to be a perceived need for a coordinated change, sharing costs/risks and preventing compartmentalisation and silos. When using a large cloud provider, users give their power to make sustainability changes away to the provider. One just has to follow. In the context of federated mini-clouds, we can perhaps find sufficient champions in sustainability NGO's. What if ... What if, instead of going (only) top-down, we could also go bottom up in some small organisations, preferably with off-the-shelf open source Cloud solutions such as OpenStack , and work towards an on-premises cloud, and find some other like-minded organisations to share resources with to create a small distributed cloud. Then we can make guides, and include some of the monitoring, provision quality, and energy savings results giving similar other organisations more choices for their decisions on how to progress towards more sustainable set-ups. What if we can pave ways? Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for that very purpose.

    "c": "Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by Ty Myrddin Published on September 08, 2019 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights consists of 30 articles affirming an individual’s rights which, although not legally binding in themselves, have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties, economic transfers, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions, and other laws. The Declaration was the first step in the process of formulating the International Bill of Human Rights, which was completed in 1966, and came into force in 1976, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified them. Some legal scholars have argued that because countries have constantly invoked the Declaration for more than 50 years, it has become binding as a part of customary international law. Courts of several countries have concluded that the Declaration is not in and of itself part of domestic law. Article 12 No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. Article 25 Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection. Article 26 Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit. Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

    "c": "Information war technology by Ty Myrddin Published on September 27, 2019 States are increasingly launching non-lethal attacks against an enemy’s information systems and people – this is the rise of information warfare. Not only is it a geopolitical “game”, states are also attacking their own people for maintaining dominance, corporations do to get you to buy their stuff, political groups are attacking other political groups for believing in something else, and individuals take out their frustration on others. Information warfare may involve collection of tactical information, assurance(s) that one’s own information is valid, spreading of propaganda or disinformation to demoralize or manipulate the enemy and the public, undermining the quality of opposing force information and denial of information-collection opportunities to opposing forces. Information warfare is closely linked to psychological warfare. In the big, and often also, in the small. Therefor researching the patterns of psychological warfare is easy. One can simply observe them in oneself and in ones own circles. For example, the myth of technological sufficiency that many depending on the system seem to believe in, identifies technology as the critical factor to solve any issue. Yet more technology is not likely to end any large scale (political) warfare. The new black bag is digital Over the past decade specially-trained CIA clandestine operators have mounted over one hundred extremely sensitive black bag jobs designed to penetrate foreign government and military communications and computer systems, as well as the computer systems of some of the world’s largest foreign multinational corporations. Spyware software has been secretly planted in computer servers; secure telephone lines have been bugged; fiber optic cables, data switching centres and telephone exchanges have been tapped; and computer backup tapes and disks have been stolen or surreptitiously copied in these operations. In other words, the CIA has become instrumental in setting up the shadowy surveillance dragnet that has now been thrown into public view. Sources within the U.S. intelligence community confirm that since 9/11, CIA clandestine operations have given the NSA access to a number of new and critically important targets around the world, especially in China and elsewhere in East Asia, as well as the Middle East, the Near East, and South Asia. ~ The CIA’s New Black Bag Is Digital, 2013 And it is not just the CIA, it resembles a panopticon in which all previously colonising countries are involved, to secure their continuity, intake of oil and rare earth elements, enhanced power and authority, status pursuit of ideological goals and objectives and general growth of their agency, marginalising entire populations of nation states with the assistance of local elites in the process. “Generations” of weapons “All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe that we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.” ~ Sixth generation warfare: manipulating space and time EMP weapons (electro-magnetic-pulse), HEMP (high altitude EMP), E-bombs (electromagnetic bombs), magnetic flux compression generator/microwave and/or radio-frequency radiation. 7GW? “Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the director of the opponent’s fate.” ~ Sun Tzu Information warfare is a concept involving the battlespace use and management of information and communication technology in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent. Information warfare is the manipulation of information trusted by a target without the target’s awareness so that the target will make decisions against their interest but in the interest of the one conducting information warfare. As a result, it is not clear when information warfare begins, ends, and how strong or destructive it is. Information warfare may involve the collection of tactical information, assurance(s) that one’s own information is valid, spreading of propaganda or disinformation to demoralize or manipulate the enemy and the public, undermining the quality of the opposing force’s information and denial of information-collection opportunities to opposing forces.

    "c": "Capturing credentials by Ty Myrddin Published on February 24, 2023 Image credit: Xkcd Some of the most common techniques adversaries use to capture credentials include finding or guessing credentials, and passing or relaying password hashes. Finding credentials Password storage targets on Windows after a compromise include operating system memory, user files such as Excel spreadsheets, and email inboxes and sent boxes, various system files like powershell history, the registry, and sticky notes. Attackers might try harvesting credentials stored in webserver configuration files and application files, operating system memory, a web browsers' autocomplete history or password manager, hard-coded in applications, and in cloud applications . The two most common ways for an adversary to intercept passwords is via an on-path attack , also known as Man in the Middle (MitM) attack, and via exploiting promiscuous protocols, such as LLMNR and NetBIOS, IPv6, and MDNS. An example of the first is poisoning Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables in a network switching device, getting it to forward traffic to an unauthorised port before being forwarded to its intended destination, waiting for a password hash, then pulling the hash offline for cracking it. Promiscuous protocols that can be tricked into sending a password hash to an unvetted recipient can result in a breach if the password is not long enough and is not difficult to guess . Guessing credentials Insecure web applications in general can be abused to bypass application access control lists (ACLs) or forge valid tokens. Adversaries confronted with a secure web application which does not leak platform, patch or configuration information; with code that protects against injection and scripting attacks; and with strong account access and lockout controls, may still try password guessing. Password lockout policies can sometimes be bypassed with password spraying . Passing or relaying password hashes The Windows NTLM algorithm algorithm is susceptible to the well-known pass-the-hash attack. Newer Windows authentication algorithms such as Net-NTLM hashes make use of a one-time challenge. But if message signing is not both enabled and required by every host in the domain, these challenges can be relayed by attackers. Relaying attacks can be done via cross-protocol relays that use any other protocol that supports Windows Net-NTLM authentication. Even Kerberos authentication , though more secure, can be successfully attacked. In some cases, Kerberos can be abused to impersonate other users within the environment and forge a valid ticket. And social engineering is still one of the most effective ways adversaries can use. Phishing seems to be the most popular choice. These attacks use persuasion techniques such as impersonating technical support personnel, name-dropping a person of authority, communicating a sense of urgency, and using plenty of technical jargon and alphabet soup to confuse users and elicit compliance. \"For verification purposes, please give us the code we just sent to you.\" Bypassing MFA The easiest way to bypass MFA is to social engineer. Another way could be to look for configurations that allow authentication that bypasses MFA, like application programming interfaces (APIs) or clients who do not require MFA, such as Exchange Web Services and Exchange Modern Authentication, which can provide a non-2FA-protected backdoor login. MFA-protected user accounts may not yet have been set up. For the adversary, time to do so. This is not quiet though, as the original user gets locked out of their account and will sound the alarm. A common bypass technique is to use the hashed Windows NTLM password hash to access functionality not protected by MFA. And last but not least, MFA systems need a fallback plan, and any weaknesses in a fail-open plan can be exploited. Adding biometrics? Adding fingerprint on top? FaceID?

Impact People, and companies and nations of all sizes have to defend against multiple threat events like ransomware, attacks going after personally identifiable information (PII) and the associated identity theft and possible further compromise, and scenarios in nation-state-sponsored global cyberwarfare, including boots-on-the-ground warfare contexts that involve digital communications.

    "c": "Grey areas by Ty Myrddin Published on May 07, 2021 The creation of legal grey areas, per three examples, using the example of sexual consent for clarity and because that is where the “consent” concept originated and is expanding from in everyday life for digital consent. Sexual consent I don’t think “sexual consent” exists other than as a legal term. If I “consent”, it means “I voluntarily agree to engage in a certain sexual activity”. Further, let’s assume I had both the freedom and capacity to consent, then the question is whether I agree to the activity by choice, not by coercion or force. A grey area. If the other person “did not reasonably believe” that I consented and continued to engage in sexual behaviour despite me saying “no”, he or she committed a sexual offence. This makes rape victims the key element in the issues surrounding consent and where common notions of victim-blaming often come into play: “The clothing she wore was an invitation”, “She was drunk”, “We live together”, and “We’ve had sex before”, etc. As far as I know, wearing clothes, having a drink, living together with someone, or having mutually consenting sex, are not criminal activities. Ofcourse there are those who want pleasurable and mutual consensual sexuality to move away from the old “no means no” mindset towards the concept of “affirmative consent”: “yes means yes” because it promises more “pushing of will”. Affirmative consent is not just about getting permission, but about making sex based on mutual desire and enthusiasm. A wonderful ideal to strive for. But re-inventing the wheel by using “yes means yes” instead of “no means no” does not remove the grey area. With ‘yes means yes’ we imply that every person has the power to say what they truly want when it comes to consent. This ignores the reality that people say ‘yes’ sometimes out of fear, and sometimes as a result of coercion . How about no forcing of will or coercion to push will on others, period. General Data Protection Regulation Digital consent follows similar patterns. The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is, in summary, a series of protocols that creates rules for businesses in Europe on how to process and maintain data collected from European residents. At first glance, the GDPR champions the rights of and consent of everyday internet users and targets a supposed grey-area black hat tactics that have exploited unsuspecting people browsing the internet. But it wasn’t a grey area, it was a black area, and by regulating the collection of data it actually legitimises the processing and maintenance of data from European residents and creates a grey area in which users can give consent or opt-in or opt-out, and have to apply to have their data removed and/or to be forgotten. Hours after the GDPR came into force users were confronted with consent-or-be-gone types of messages and large suits against Facebook and Google appeared, accusing them of “coercing” users into accepting their data collection policies. And as a “side note”, the legislation was purely for the private sector in order to “protect the public”. What about the public institutions funded by taxes from the people that are protected under the GDPR? What impact does the GDPR have on governing institutions? What do governments in Europe have to do because of the GDPR? Apparently nothing: “under EU law, the right to privacy and the right to protection of personal data are two distinct fundamental human rights.” The European Parliament distances itself from national authorities collecting and processing citizens private data by allocating all such activities to the nation alone, The Court of Justice of the EU does not have jurisdiction over cases that involve surveillance conducted by national authorities in order to safeguard the internal security of the EU Members. How about no collection of data, period. Federated Learning of Cohorts Third-party cookies are gradually going extinct now that many browsers block them, but that doesn’t mean Google (and similar others) will respect our privacy. Google started an experiment called FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts). It runs in Google’s Chrome browser and tracks a user’s online behaviour. Supposedly FLoC will allow personalized ads without the collection of data that can be tied to specific people. By assigning each browser an anonymised ID and then adding that ID into a large group, a cohort, where only the overall patterns are accessible to advertisers, the idea is that our privacy will remain intact, while Google and its advertising partners use it for widespread tracking and personalisation of ads. Marshall Vale, the product manager of Google’s privacy sandbox: “Before a cohort becomes eligible, Chrome analyzes it to see if the cohort is visiting pages with sensitive topics, such as medical websites or websites with political or religious content, at a high rate. If so, Chrome ensures that the cohort isn’t used, without learning which sensitive topics users were interested in.” Sounds awesome, but what is really happening and possible in this grey area? A user’s browser, a tool to interact with the internet, is supposed to be sacred. FLoC turns it into a real-time tracking tool collecting the most sensitive information about an individual user’s browsing habits without the user being able to circumvent or opt out of this data collection. And when the FLoC data set is big enough, deanonymisation will become easy . For example, cohorts of users sharing the same location data, shopping in the same neighbourhood, being active in the same time zone, can easily be grouped together by demographics, and if the data is combined with other tracking mechanisms such as social media analytics or data sets purchased from data brokers , fingerprinting users based on age, class, ethnicity, political parties becomes trivial. Google announced that in Chrome version 89 they will forcibly enable and trial their FLoC data-collection initiative without the consent of users or webmasters. Our options are reduced to “You either have old tracking or new tracking”, but you are going to get it anyway? Not entirely, because users and webserver adminstrators and webmasters can jump through hoops, again. It is annoying, very annoying, these constant attacks on our privacy. How about no tracking, period. And as a “side note”: Wouldn’t it be good if algorithms that keep users engaged for maximising revenues by recommending (political, sensasionalist, hateful, false) content, simply did not exist?

    "c": "Defendable internet? by Ty Myrddin Published on February 2, 2023 David Clark can remember exactly when he was confronted with the Internet's dark side. Presiding over a meeting of network engineers, news broke that a dangerous computer worm was crawling through the wires. November 2, 1988, using the Internet's essential open nature, the first worm crashed 6000 machines, then one-tenth of the Internet. Those who developed this early network further, focused on the technical challenges of moving information quickly and reliably. They did not focus on how you could wreck this system intentionally, claiming online crime and aggression are the manifestation of basic human needs and wants, beyond easy technological solutions. Decades later, in 2023, the threats seem to be exploding. The targets for destruction have leapt from computers to banks, retailers, government agencies, critical mechanical systems in dams, power plants and aircraft, mobile apps and phones, clouds, our private data. Adversaries seem to be winning. Most likely because they have the luxury to focus only on the technical aspects of their work, while defenders have to navigate complex political and regulatory environments . If defenders did not have to deal with such issues, they could maybe focus on how to redesign the Internet to make it an open, transparent, and yet secure internet for all to enjoy. And with enough funding ofcourse. Thomas Dullien and Halvar Flake also explored why we are not building such a defendable internet : who is motivated by who to do what - and how these incentives fail to produce the security level we desire. Five years later, at Black Hat Europe 2022, the question returns, with an answer raising more questions: A defendable internet is possible, but only with industry makeover . A makeover which is unlikely to happen, as are all the other make-overs needed, for example for closing inequality gaps to bring a more just economical balance to the world, and a makeover for substantially reducing the effect we humans are having on the environment, other species, and next generations. I have some questions on this \"dark side\", by which I mean the \"ignored impacts on others and the future\": Are the minds of those that feel like they are \"the winners\" locked into \"winning\", pretty much like drug addicts get \"locked in\" on the next shot/drink? Does short term thinking rule the mind of those \"up top\"? Does the \"now\" command more attention than effects on the future? Is it a legacy replacement problem? We know *that* one. The continuous putting out fires leaves no time for replacement efforts (until it is all burned down and there is nothing left to replace but some ashes). Why is it difficult to look beyond the next news cycle/catastrophe/breach? If time can be sliced, is it only getting finer, with ever-shorter periods shaping our (digital) world? Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for that very purpose.

    "c": "Exploding hand-helds by Ty Myrddin Published on Sept 25, 2024 Cartoon by Joe Heller: Exploding pagers So what happened The first round of blasts began in Lebanon's capital Beirut and several other areas of the country at about 15:30 local time on Tuesday 17 september 2024 involving pagers. Another round of blasts, now from walkie-talkies, happened on Wednesday the 18th, at around 17:00 local time. Some of the pagers used by Hezbollah are models that run on lithium-ion batteries , which can cause dangerous explosions. According to information obtained by LBCI , the pager server can have been compromised, leading to the installation of a script that caused an overload. This then could have resulted in the overheating of the lithium battery, which then exploded. But it is unlikely that a regular pager battery alone can produce blasts that can injure multiple people (as was seen in some of the recorded attacks). It seems more likely the pagers were interdicted and modified with explosives. Interdiction Using so-called \"interdiction\", the target hardware is intercepted while on route to a next supplier in the supply chain. The hardware must be unpackaged, modified, repackaged and put back in the chain without raising red flags. Using \"Seeding\" is probably even harder, because the manipulation happens on the factory floor. Access in both cases can be gained by social engineering, like posing as officials, bribery, threatening an insider, etcetera. Hardware supply chain attacks are extremely hard to defend from . Once the hardware is successfully modified, adversaries can use the back door to gain further access or exfiltrate data, it is difficult to detect and fix, and gives long-term access. It is entirely possible that explosives planted in the pagers were detonated using a remote command, perhaps hidden in a pager message. But erm? there is not much space in the devices. Which explosives were that then? Targeting costs To make it a targeted attack the attacker would need an operative to make sure the modified devices are delivered to the targets and not just anyone. This requires a mole, or a bribe. And time. How long does it take to infiltrate Hezbollah providers to the point of delivering hundreds of devices? Why this attack? Buying time? Replacing a large number of pagers will take time. Deterrence? The first round came just hours after Israel's security cabinet made the safe return of residents to the north of the country an official war goal. Showing the depth of Israel's intelligence pockets might deter Hezbollah. Amos Yadlin , a former head of Israeli military intelligence, said the Israeli attack displayed \"very impressive penetration capabilities, technology and intelligence.\" The deterrence factor however, does not seem to be working. Did anyone else notice the use of the word \"penetration\"? What on Earth do they think they are doing? And it is not a surprise either. Similar capabilities were already shown. Still, the scale of this attack seems \"unprecedented\". As mp wrote: \"In other words, it seems to me, this action is only really possible (\"easy\") if you are already deeply invested in the dark arts of arms trafficking and dealing, which is to say: embedded in the global, criminal economy. It is statecraft.\" Western response There are UN accusations that this constitutes a war crime, as well as congratulations on the ingenuity of the attack, while it injured at least 2800 people and killed at least nine. But not really an outcry. I have not seen a real outcry on what is happening in Gaza either, by the way. Have we gone numb because of all the war and killing ? The best explanation I have seen is from Patrice: \"In general, I think there is by now a weariness to address the increasingly dystopian aspect of tech, wether it's corporate or military developed and deployed, since (i) it makes one very depressive (ii) it won't help anyway\" Historically, technological advances are double-edged swords. Technology has been used against us, while claimed to have been designed to help us. Such opportunism rules mankind. What if our governments are taken over by less-democratic forces? If hand-held devices, such as walkie-talkies or pagers, can be implanted with explosives and can kill targets, how safe are any of us from this mode of attack? Posting this is also unlikely to help, but I feel slightly better. Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for that very purpose.

For example, the escape sequence ' ' can represent a newline character, and '\\t' a tab. But if a backslash is followed by an invalid character, it raises a warning. In general, a warning does not halt program execution, but it is essential to address these warnings, as they can indicate potential issues with the code.

    "c": "Governmental ghost stories by Ty Myrddin Published on February 17, 2020 This old-fashioned horror anthology isn’t terrifying or scream-inducing; instead, it’s closer in spirit to the moody, clammy, atmospheric English movies of decades past, and parodies thereof. I am again reminded of Dr. Strangelove. The UK Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) Beginning of 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK’s Snooper’s Charter is unlawful . In 2018, Australia’s parliament passed legislation that allows intelligence and law enforcement agencies to demand access to encrypted communications data. And the GCHQ now wantsss that preciousss information too. Secure messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and iMessage can be forced to create backdoors or to operate a “ghost protocol” that “CC’s” an encrypted message to a third-party when it is sent. A state run Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)?!? The ghastly ghostly proposal from GCHQ was made late 2018 by its director Ian Levy, and involved “silently adding a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call”, according to the “Principles for a More Informed Exceptional Access Debate” article written by Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson. The Letter Then a coalition of 47 organisations and individuals wrote to the GCHQ, raising objections to the proposal to insert privileged users in encrypted conversations, in order for the government to spy on such interactions without actually breaking encryption. The GCHQ “ghost protocol” would seriously undermine user security and trust. O Really?!? And while I do think it is an excellent idea to bring it to the table, among the signets are also Apple and Facebook’s WhatsUp. Ironically, Facebook is the biggest and worst example of how business models arrogate and appropriate data about us, read all our emails, comments, and other things we put online and behind the scenes with friends, family, business connections, in order that this content might be tied into our profiles and make us easier targets for their paying customers – the advertisers and marketers of big and small organisations – to drill down into our inner desires and close that all important sale. And Apple continues to give the impression it thinks privacy is worth fighting for, even if only as a business Unique Selling Point. The intrusive activities and long-term business models of “data science” are Silicon Valley’s very own(ed) ghost protocol.

    "c": "Five Eyes alliance by Ty Myrddin Published on August 28, 2018 The UKUSA agreement, first called the BRUSA Agreement, was signed in March 1946 for cooperation in signals intelligence between the UK and the USA. It was extended to include Canada in 1948 and Australia and New Zealand in 1956. It was a secret agreement until 1999 when it was disclosed by the Australian Defence Signals Directorate. Nowadays, it’s called the Five Eyes (FVEY). On June 25, 2010, the agreement was (partially) disclosed by Britain and the United States . The UK link requires payment. This repository is a complete collection of all documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden that have subsequently been published by news media around the world. Created to share signals intelligence between allies, the agreement was intended to streamline the collection and analysis of intercepted data and communications. There is thought to be around 130 known listening stations worldwide. Some are huge, such as Britain’s Menwith Hill complex, and some are small or even “internet of things”-size small and function automatically. The agreement standardises terminology, codes, clearances, handling procedures and access to facilities. An exchange of personnel appears common. Governments of the UKUSA members have been careful to seem to restrain their agencies from spying on their own citizens in politician and watchdog words and very clear laws, but nothing keeps the other members of the agreement from spying on their partners’ citizens and handing over that information as part of the intelligence sharing agreement. Not only that, apparently intelligence agencies are above such laws, and the laws are updated, upgraded and adapted to the actual capacities of intelligence agencies, not the other way around.

    "c": "It is not enough! by Ty Myrddin Published on April 21, 2021 The GDPR and ICCPR are not enough, and that is not only because of the tremendous struggle to implement their rules. The GDPR for example, actually legitimises the entire information industry by making it a grey area . It came into force May 25 at midnight 2018 and is supposed to give users a free choice, whether they agree to data usage or not. The opposite feeling spread on the screens of many users: tons of “consent boxes” popped up online or in applications, often combined with a threat that the service can no longer be used if users do not consent. On the first day of GDPR noyb.eu filed four complaints against Google (Android), Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram over “forced consent”. Politics no longer seems to be able to cope with six of the greatest challenges of our time: destruction of the environment, digitalisation, the power of algorithms, systematic lies in politics, unchecked globalisation and threats to the rule of law. We all want to live in an environment that is healthy and protected. We want to use the internet in a way determined by us, without being scrutinised and manipulated, we want to be able to trust intelligent machines and not be threatened by them. We have seen that the prerequisite of our democracy is truth and not lies, and we want to end the exploitation of people in a globalised world. The old constitutions of Europe have no clear answers for the enormous upheavals of recent years. ~ Sign for demanding Six New Fundamental Rights We Demand Six New Fundamental Rights A constitutional convention should expand the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to include the following fundamental rights: Article 1 - Environment Everyone has the right to live in an environment that is healthy and protected. Article 2 - Digital self-determination Everyone has the right to digital self-determination. Excessive profiling or the manipulation of people is forbidden. Article 3 - Artiﬁcial intelligence Everyone has the right to know that any algorithms imposed on them are transparent, verifiable and fair. Major decisions must be taken by a human being. Article 4 - Truth Everyone has the right to trust that statements made by the holders of public ofﬁce are true. Article 5 - Globalization Everyone has the right to be offered only those goods and services that are produced and provided in accordance with universal human rights. Article 6 - Fundamental rights lawsuits Everyone has the right to bring a lawsuit before the European Courts when the Charter’s fundamental rights are systematically violated.

    "c": "Internet (in)security trends by Ty Myrddin Published on April 22, 2021 “Gotta feel kind of bad for nation-state hackers who spend years implanting and cultivating some hardware exploit, only to discover the entire target database is already exposed to anyone with a web browser.” Most E2EE are secure against only the weakest passive adversaries, breakable not by cryptanalysis of underlying cryptographic algorithms but by flawed system designs and security assumptions. Unencrypted metadata and access patterns make these systems susceptible to inference attacks. And recently made laws seem to have been made to prepare the way for agencies to legitimately gather encrypted data via backdoors and ghost protocols. The MitM server-to-server HTTPS communication attack for example, is not about a vulnerability, it is about a flawed concept. The abstraction of trusted Internet routing is wrong. DNSsec and IPsec routing were developed as stopgaps, but make packet flow harder to troubleshoot and add excessive administrative overhead. Hackers increasingly use search engine poisoning attacks because they are so easy to do, and several automated tool-kits are readily available to make it even easier. Credential stuffing is currently one of the most common techniques used to take-over user accounts. Credential spilling is when credentials gained from data breaches are sold to other adversaries. Credential stuffing is the large scale use of automated means to test stolen passwords against other unrelated websites. This is a possible and often successful attack because of the tendency for users to recycle their passwords for multiple accounts. Polymorphic malware created by machines are likely to develop (further). These learn to evade detection based on automated vulnerability detection and complex data analysis. DDoS and DrDoS attacks employ swarms of these vulnerable endpoints to attack public infrastructure through massively coordinated communication channels. Smarter control software exists but is costly, and certainly not available to consumer-grade endpoints. Think unpredictable spikes in infrastructure use and availability issues. Meanwhile, such poorly-protected vulnerable endpoints are ubiquitous and provide starting points for further structured attacks. And there is more to come. Mobile devices and connected sensors such as smart home devices, biochip transponders on farm animals and electric clams in coastal waters, you name it, the monitoring craze is everywhere, increasing the attack surface. Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for that very purpose. Faint traceries of blue fire crawled across the bookcases and there was a sound, a papery whispering, such as might come from a colony of roosting starlings.

Teaching The Montessori philosophy offers a holistic approach to education that recognizes the innate potential and dignity of every individual. The autonomy, self-directed learning, and respect for the individual are principles which have far-reaching implications beyond traditional educational settings. Experiential Learning Theory, is a widely recognized and influential framework that describes how people learn through experience. People can use hands-on learning processes for all forms of learning. Digital defence @home This project is about understanding the landscape and securing @home (and @smallorganisational) contexts as good as we can ourselves. The approach is to pick the raisins out of the commercial porridge. What makes sense in our respective contexts? IPA Project A project, together with Meltem Arikan, sponsored by /ut7 for supporting Intimate Partner Abuse survivors in various (digital) ways. Digital defence @home IPA Project Facilitation Facilitation is the craft of guiding a group or individual through a participatory process that makes it easier to achieve their goals. Systems thinking Systems thinking expands the range of choices available for solving a problem by broadening our thinking and helping us phrase problems in new and other ways. The principles of systems thinking can make us aware that there are no flawless solutions and that the choices we make will have an impact on other parts of the system. By anticipating the impact of trade-offs, we can minimize the impacts or even use them to our advantage. As a result, systems thinking allows us to make better informed and less damaging choices. Systems thinking, in particular causal loop diagrams can be used to tell compelling stories describing how a system works. Retrospectives Retrospectives are popular in the team-working world of the Lean and Agile community. The technique was inspired by the work of Virginia Satir. She developed a technique called the Daily Temperature Reading for keeping relationships healthy and happy. Reflecting on what has happened in the past (first the positive and then the negative) and then figuring out what to do in the future to improve. And with a bit of creativity it can be made fun and enjoyable to do. Looking forward Scenario planning originated in the U.S. military for making strategic decisions, to plan and prepare for various possible futures. Today, scenario planning is used by all kinds of organisations world-wide. Adding obliviousness and congruence awarenesses to scenario planning choreographies make it a more balanced experience and suitable for planning deductive and inductive paths to possible futures. Systems thinking example Satir Temperature Reading (pdf) Scenario logics example Software development Software Development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining computer programs and applications. C and C++ C and C++ are used for high performance and low-level control. It is suited for backend systems, computationally intensive processes, and applications that require precise memory control. Been there, done that in the stone age of computer science. At the moment not much to show, but for some snippets. Python Python is simple, versatile, and readable, and often used for web development, data analysis, and AI. It is perfect for frontend scripts, prototyping, data manipulation, and creating user-friendly APIs for C++-based backend systems. A lot of frameworks (25+) have been developed for Python, providing a structure for the code and a set of tools and features that streamline the development process. Examples are Flask and FastAPI. Python frameworks Flask is a lightweight micro-framework used to quickly build simple web applications. It includes support for Jinja templates (a way to reuse HTML code), request handling, and application signaling. Both FastAPI and Starlette are built on top of Uvicorn, which is an ASGI server, but they serve different purposes and offer distinct features that can impact performance. Starlette provides the foundational tools for building web applications. It is lightweight and optimized for speed, making it suitable for simple applications. FastAPI is built on top of Starlette, adding features like automatic data validation and serialization. AI Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undoubtedly revolutionizing numerous fields, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment. Its potential to enhance efficiency, solve complex problems, and drive innovation is enormous. So is its energy use. The rapid advancement and integration of AI into society also raises significant ethical, social, and technical concerns that warrant critical examination. Exploring the various AI techniques can support such research (see below threat modelling example). Reverse engineering Flask application on headless (Netlify) Typesense, Starlette Search engine (under construction) Various explorations in AI Security Threat modelling Threat modeling is the process of using hypothetical scenarios, system diagrams, and testing to help secure systems and data. Deanonymisation refers to the process of reversing the anonymisation of data, thereby revealing the identity of individuals who were previously anonymous. This practice has significant implications for privacy, security, and ethics, particularly in an era where vast amounts of data are collected, shared, and analyzed. Pentesting A vulnerability assessment focuses on scanning hosts for vulnerabilities as individual entities. Penetration tests might start by scanning for vulnerabilities just as a regular vulnerability assessment but pentesting gives more information on how an attacker can chain vulnerabilities to achieve specific goals. During pentesting, focus remains on identifying vulnerabilities and establishing measures to protect the network, but it also considers the network as a whole ecosystem and how an attacker could profit from interactions between its components. Red teaming Red teaming is a term borrowed from the military. In military exercises, the red team simulates attack techniques to test the reaction capabilities of a defending blue team against known adversary strategies. In cybersecurity, the red team emulates a real threat actor's Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for measuring how well the blue team responds and to test any security controls in place. Usually the blue team is made up of members of a security incident response team (SIRT) and/or security operations team (SOC) , but in a small organisation can consist of the systems administrator with interested parties. Red teaming does not replace penetration testing. It complements it by focusing on detection and response rather than prevention. Red teaming improves penetration testing by taking into account more attack...",

    "c": "Raising security awareness The usual suspects A lot of funds are spent on security equipment, firewalls, encryption, pentesting, red teaming, you name it. And if someone can walk out the door with files under their arm, or a manager signs off on a control which does not work, or if someone clicks on a link in a phishing email, the keys to the king or queendom may well be within reach of an adversary. Curiosities, biases, and susceptibilities, can all be potential gateways. The good news is, these very human traits can also be used to improve security. Confirmation bias can make people assume an attack is done by a specific threat actor. Confirming that looking at alternative scenarios, and actively challenging existing belief systems can work to improve security stances. Bandwagon bias leads to taking the road traveled by everyone else. How about jumping on the bandwagon of building more diverse teams, fostering critical thinking, and encouraging devil’s advocate perspectives? Hindsight bias can cause vulnerabilities to remain undiscovered, even with many eyes on the code. When such a vulnerability is found, we can apply hindsight bias to the hindsight bias, and learn about the dangers of this particular bias. People more and more gather information from reading articles the internet and sharing with colleagues, including on how hackers target cognitive biases. Anchoring bias can cause risks with low likelihood or low impact to be viewed as more likely to happen than they really are in a specific context. Drop the anchor in improving internal communication for determining raw risks and residual risks. Test driven efforts There is no way to measure the success of security awareness efforts unless the behaviours that need to change are (continuously) identified. Measuring raising security awareness success requires building an evaluation framework that uses communication, simulated events, event logging and monitoring, and assessments to test its effectiveness from multiple perspectives. And in organisational contexts, nothing will work if management does not create an environment in which people (can) trust leadership to be learning too. And then get going making security fun, growing security thinking, care and guts, while tracking progress from currently perceived state to the next desired state. Hands-on workshops Learning goes best when it is made fun, takes one day, is done off-site, and includes discussing experiences. Experiential learning is the process of learning through hands-on experience, building upon what one knows to expand that knowledge into action. It is one of the most beneficial types of learning because one gets out of an experience what one puts in, and allows people to better retain what is learned and can be used for raising awareness. That which was experienced can not be unexperienced. Simulations and roleplay After having done some experiential training, up next could be simulations set up for specific situations in specific contexts of the organisation. This can even go as far as colourful teaming where a red team and blue team play out imaginary attack and defense scenarios. Human-readable guides Just like in pentesting, reports and guides have to be adapted for specific audiences, without “talking down”. The term “human-readable” implies information that is meaningful for people and that can be comprehended quickly. I do try. The very best guides are produced by and for people (in an organisation), after an experience making them the domain experts, after a hands-on exercise, or after a simulation.

    "c": " No instant transportation Digital security is a fascinating field to work in; it is not the good guys vs bad guys, white hats vs gray hats vs black hats, or about computer science, math and teaching degrees (although I have them). Technical knowledge is important, but that is just logic. A love for puzzling, not being afraid of new experiences, a lifetime of learning, understanding what makes people tick, and supporting others , will give better results. Never Up To Date People's devices, their data, and people themselves can be at risk. We need to prevent, find, and fix these vulnerabilities, before an attacker takes advantage. I do not assume I know it all, nor that which was valid yesterday, will be valid today. I keep researching and learning, and can transfer the knowledge and skills I do keep and make sense in context, and bring positive attitudes to the table. With Love Working with threats and threat modelling requires a paranoia mindset. A higher paranoia level makes it harder for an attacker to go undetected. It all depends on the possible impact what level of paranoia is needed. This can be unhealthy for our minds. I use humour. Laughing brings oxygen to the brain, which reduces the effects of paranoia. On top of that, an oxygenated mind is more relaxed and has a much greater capacity for clear thinking.

Smaller organisations can perhaps not afford such costs at all, unless we get creative and find new forms which are just as effective, perhaps even more.

The apt-key deprecation message reads, \" Warning: apt-key is deprecated. Manage keyring files in trusted.gpg.d instead (see apt-key(8)) \", and \" Key is stored in legacy trusted.gpg keyring (/etc/apt/trusted.gpg), see the DEPRECATION section in apt-key(8) for details. \" Long story short, installing a key in the global keyring the way we used to mean that any packages signed by that key are trusted. The new [signed-by] option limits the damage when a repository's keys are compromised; the key cannot be used to forge packages unrelated to the repository itself and limits the damage done. New repositories need to be signed in a different way, and existing keys need to be exported to /usr/share/keyrings and the associated source.list files adapted to reflect that change. Below is a summarized version of applying the excellent instructions given by Debian and apt-key Is Deprecated. How To Add OpenPGP Repository Signing Keys Without It On Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Etc. for our setup in Ubuntu 22.04. Note that curl can be used instead of wget , and that key extensions can also be .pgp , .asc , .key , .whatever , as long as it is a key in a format apt supports. If a key is not ascii-armored, gpg will exit successfully without changing anything. If apt chokes on the resulting key, it is likely because the key is in another format like the newer binary \"keybox database\" format, which apt does not support. Adding keys the new way Checking whether a key is armored: $ wget https://example.com/key/repo-key.gpg $ file repo-key.gpg If the answer is repo-key.gpg: PGP public key block Public-Key (old) , then it is an armored key, but there is no harm in piping through --dearmor by default. Armored keys: $ wget -O- <https://example.com/key/repo-key.gpg> | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/<myrepository>-archive-keyring.gpg Non-armored keys: $ wget -O- <https://example.com/key/repo-key.gpg> | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/<myrepository-archive-keyring.gpg> Getting keys from a keyserver: $ sudo gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/<myrepository>-archive-keyring.gpg --keyserver <hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80> --recv-keys <fingerprint> All keys will be stored in the /usr/share/keyrings/ folder to be used in adding the repository with the signed-by option in a sources.list file.

The below method also works for re-enabling repositories that use install scripts and do not have their signing keys listed on their sites, like for nordvpn and slack . Moving keys from /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d First move all existing keyring files in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ to the (newly created) /usr/local/share/keyrings/ directory as-is . /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d$ sudo mv repo-key.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/ Then, using an editor of choice, update all the corresponding .list files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d to have the [signed-by] field referencing its own key (as described above), and remove the hash that disabled the repository.

    "c": "CommonJS to ESM by Ty Myrddin Updated on January 3, 2022 The react-base app was originally bootstrapped with Create React App using --template typescript . The available npm start , npm test and npm run build scripts work fine. But adding an index.js with a mix of commonJS and ES modules and doing an import of .json files, is a problem. Apparently modules are in transition but not all are ESM yet. We will hold our experimentations with such index.js files trying to use node-fetch and ngrok for now. We may come back to this later again. For now, we just used the Nginx on the droplet. Troubles Having added an index.js to the react-base project (node v16.13.1) for trying out ngrok : import env from './src/env/.env.json'; const handler = require(\"serve-handler\"); const http = require(\"http\"); const ngrok = require(\"ngrok\"); const fetch = require(\"node-fetch\"); ... running node index.js throws an error and trying to solve that we could be going around in circles. ES modules The implementation is now stable and can be used with the earlier commonJS module system. (Statement valid for version 13.14.0 and above). This means that files ending with .mjs or .js extensions (with the nearest package.json file with a field type) are treated as ES modules. First run $ node index.js (node:686975) Warning: To load an ES module, set \"type\": \"module\" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension. [snip] SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module Adding \"type: module\" to the package.json file enables ES6 modules. In ES6, the source code should use import syntax. Previous ES use require syntax. Sticking to ES5 We changed the import in the index.js to a require and it worked, but a lot of other files now give the same error. With type:module In the to the index.js nearest parent package.json file, we added a top-level \"type\" field with a value of \"module\": // package.json { [snip] \"type\": \"module\" [snip] } Problem solved, BUT, this gives another error message: TypeError [ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION]: Unknown file extension \".json\" for /react-base/src/env/.env.json Apparently, JSON module import is experimental ? It is supported only in commonJS mode, not in modules. Supposedly adding the flag —experimental-json-modules with node fixes this error and make commonJS and module mode works with .json file import. $ node --experimental-json-modules index.js Results in this error: file:///react-base/index.js:3 const handler = require(\"serve-handler\"); ^ ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and '/react-base/package.json' contains \"type\": \"module\". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension. Renaming index.js to index.cjs and $ node --experimental-json-modules index.cjs results in: SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module And we are back at the beginning. Rewriting imports The index.js tries to use both import and require module patterns, which isn’t possible. We either have to rewrite the \"require\" statements in index.js to \"imports\", like: import pkg from 'serve-handler'; const { handler } = pkg; But serve-handler , http , and ngrok are all commonJS modules, and doing this can lead to unexpected effects. We tried, just for the heck of it. So we undo the \"type\": \"module\", in package.json and rewrite the import env from './src/env/.env.json'; to a commonJS require: const env = require('./src/env/.env.json'); : $ node index.js /react-base/index.js:5 const fetch = require(\"node-fetch\"); ^ Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /react-base/node_modules/node-fetch/src/index.js from /react-base/index.js not supported. Instead change the require of /react-base/node_modules/node-fetch/src/index.js in /react-base/index.js to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules. node-fetch And the next problem appears: node-fetch was converted to be an ESM only package in version 3.0.0-beta.10 . It is now an ESM-only module and can not be imported with require. the async import() function from CommonJS to load node-fetch asynchronously: const fetch = (...args) => import('node-fetch').then(({default: fetch}) => fetch(...args)); Or downgrade to node-fetch version 2.6.6, which is built with CommonJS. <= For now WHERE'S MY COW?!

Its buildings are of ancient stone, and contain many dark, winding corridors and small rooms, far more than the size of the grounds should allow. UU Wizards study magic for many years the hard way. Reading an uncountable number of books, passing hard tests, getting one (or several) of the many degrees available and practicing all day long makes a great wizard. Few faculty members like to teach. They have virtual lectures in a classroom, (Room 3b) that does not exist, a happy arrangement mutually understood and respected by Faculty and students alike. On Wizardry Works with your device Wizards like to use instruments specially made for the purposes of practicing magic.

    "c": "Legitimisation patterns by Ty Myrddin Published on October 13, 2020 Legitimate power is based on a structural relationship (or rather the acceptance of economic stratification or other forms of hierarchy) between the influencing agent and the target. Implicitly, or explicitly, the agent says, “I have a right (the position) to ask you to do this and you have an obligation (the position) to comply”. When words like “obliged” or “obligated”, “should”, “ought to”, “must”, and “are required to” are used, they may signal an attempt at “legitimisation of power” (which even if accepted by a society, may not be considered lawful in more common sense perceptions or by a questioning individual). Legitimacy can be understood as a capital of recognition (Bourdieu). This symbolic capital makes a coercive force be accepted for whom it “suffers”. Power becomes authority when it possesses “capital of legitimisation”. However, bearing in mind that throughout political history of the West that capital of legitimacy has function and has been stated in diverse ways, this distinction between power and authority must take in the multiple and diverse forms in which both have been conceived. There are mainly three legitimacy paradigms that can synthesize the earlier mentioned history: the paradigm of difference, that of equality, and that of interdependency between difference and equality. Each one of these paradigms entails different ways of conceiving the legitimate power and the illegitimate power: within difference the legitimate power is the sacred force owned by the sovereign over the subordinate who lacks power (since the illegitimate power lacks formulation it can only be conceived as a resistant practice). within equality the legitimate power is the determination of the collection of equals (system, nation, society, …) over oneself, it is the self-created or emerging domain from a systemic collection of relations, while the illegitimate and subjective power splits up, fragments or scatters the whole, and at the same time progresses producing “illegitimacy”. within interdependence the power assimilates the tension between potential (possibility) and force in action, all power and all authority is conceived as disintegrating and subjective, a degree of recognition between different ones who do not give up difference and who recognize themselves on it as equally strongly linked in interdependency webs where the possibility of better balanced relationships appears.

    "c": "Scenario logics by Ty Myrddin Published on April 26, 2022, From a scenario planning done in 2013, with some of the measurables and observables that had appeared by 2022: Obliviousness and congruence Plot In scenario planning everything is a prediction. None of it is real. All predictions are wrong. And that which gets overlooked in most (if not all) digital scenarios is reality. For example: We belong to a finite planet, with finite resources. Likely effects Constraints on economic development (but not for transnational players in the neoliberal network). Corporations and businesses already show a trend of making employees make do with what they have and requests made by employees for better resources (to serve customers with) are ignored, leaving employees in a very difficult place – unable to do their job properly and on top of that, likely to be penalised for ‘poor performance’. This could lead to people feeling burned out and frustrated. Performance will drop as a result and so will demand and profits. Instead of dealing with it (just as with addicts facing a scarcity of the resource they are dependent on), over-use of resources, such as the depletion of rain forests and over-fishing can occur. Opportunism can increase. Misuse of scarce resources is also likely. The effect of inflation tends to be stronger for low-income individuals, whom inflation renders relatively more vulnerable, thereby increasing inequality. Lack of material resources - chronic (low income) and situational (inflation) lack of material resources - causes people to make harsher moral judgments and be more (often) physically ill. Measurables and observables Many of the metals needed to feed the surging global demand for high-tech products, from smartphones to solar panels, cannot be replaced, according to a Yale study, On the materials basis of modern society The British Geological Survey (BGS) Risk List states that economically important metals with high levels of risk to supply disruption including antimony (with application as a fire retardant), bismuth (used in numerous medical applications), platinum group metals (active components in auto-catalysts), and tungsten (a key hard metal used in most cutting tools), particularly the rare earth elements and antimony, have low recycling rates and a limited number of substitutes. They are also almost exclusively mined as by-product metals. The minimum total power that was required to run (wall socket power) and maintain (embody) the internet in 2017 was guesstimated to be somewhere between ~131 GW + ~167 GW = ~298 GW and ~204 GW + ~288 GW = ~492 GW. Surveillance society Plot A government steps in to protect its citizens from (potential) dissident and/or criminal actions and/or information that might “corrupt” its citizens. (Intelligence) Agencies use data-mining to identify (potential) individual dissidents and criminals. Government steps in to protect its individual citizens’ privacy from being mined by non-state-actors and to create distraction from their own mining activities. Strong privacy regulations emerge. Citizens are increasingly being targeted in surveillance with surveillance tools purchased from China. Likely effects Organisations (Cartels, corporations, companies, NGO’s) are restricted in their use of data. Consumerism is stifled. Governments will try to shift responsibility to individual citizens. Identity theft and ransomware boom. Individual citizens and citizen groups supported by NGO’s call for “making the internet more safe (for children/women/dissidents)”. Governments try to regulate again and surveillance increases. Companies offering private and protected access to online services and make a lot of money. Mobile devices are closed and curated. Because people need to appear perfect to others, the need to appear perfect to oneself increases also (the cognitive dissonance is too painful). Acknowledging mistakes and failures and the feelings associated with them can be hard. The surveillance society makes people have “negative emotions”. The positive thinking movement encourages people to ignore their negative emotions. Negative emotions get buried in subconscious, resulting in mood swings, unexplained sadness, and mild depression, and eventually in aggression. Suppressing negative emotions may lead to depression, low self-esteem, and even physical illness in extreme cases. Suppressing emotions is a risk factor in premature death, including death from cancer. Negative emotions are dumped elsewhere on innocent people. NGO’s will need more funding to respond with new/more support for women and children (at home) and dissidents (elsewhere). Consciously constantly suppressing emotions can cause emotional numbness. It is common to hear the phrases “We live in stressful times” and “It is what it is” (with a shrug) and “You shouldn’t feel this way. Everything is alright. You need to be positive.” Measurables and observables The attack patterns may or may not have to do with psychogenic forces and deep states and include women and children more targeted more by teensy weensy petty tyrants, little petty tyrants and minor petty tyrants. human rights activists, journalists, land defenders, and political dissidents targeted more by petty tyrants. identity theft and ransomware attacks happening via automated botnets. (Intelligence) Agencies increasingly using data-mining or bying data from brokers to identify “(potential) individual dissidents and criminals”. The old EU Data Protection Directive of 1995 was outdated. It failed to cover for example, social networking sites, cloud computing, location-based services, smart cards and biometric data, and in 2012 the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the EU’s data protection rules to strengthen privacy rights and boost Europe’s digital economy. Unlike directives, the new GDPR that came into force in 2018 does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation. It is directly binding and applicable. Note that the GDPR only addresses privacy concerns related to data processing by private sector and not by individual Member States. With the internet being a global network (driven by established interests), laws regarding for example, digital fingerprinting by intelligence agencies, may develop completely differently from one country to another regardless of raised concerns at the EU level as to the compatibility of such activities with human rights standards. Interventions by governments Plot Corporations, enterprises and NGO’s are targets in this scenario. A government attempts to regulate the situation in order to protect the targets and itself. All infrastructure becomes critical. The targets are held responsible. Attacks are perceived as cyber war events. Cyber warfare breaks out. Likely effects Increased cost (capital) for businesses/organisations online. Increasingly business resources are focused on compliance with regulation instead of risk assessments for gaining a profit. Botnets get taken down. More cyber criminals are caught. Opportunity cost for private petty tyrants increases. Measurables and observables The attack patterns that the (in)famous Equifax (and other) data breaches reveal, is one of negligence - only self, no real concern for customers/clients/citizens and the context of the internet. This invites government regulation while such vulnerable products do not invite perceptions of sophisticated hacking on infrastructure by other nations and acts of cyberwar that call for counterattacks. On the contrary. The JP Morgan Chase hack is a prime example of immediately perceiving cyberwar after a breach is made known. When discovered in 2014, the media were full of articles on Russian hackers attacking the U.S. financial system in retaliation against U.S. government-sponsored sanctions aimed at Russia. As it turns out in 2015, it was a “worldwide hacking ring” with four members, of which one was an American and two were Israeli’s....",

    "c": "The European Union must keep funding free software by Ty Myrddin Published on July 22, 2024 Original: https://pad.public.cat/lettre-NCP-NGI , initially published by petites singularites , English translation provided by OW2 . If you want to sign the letter, please publish the letter on your website and complete the table below on this page . Open Letter to the European Commission Since 2020, Next Generation Internet (NGI) programmes, part of European Commission's Horizon programme, fund free software in Europe using a cascade funding mechanism (see for example NLnet’s calls). This year, according to the Horizon Europe working draft detailing funding programmes for 2025, we notice that Next Generation Internet is not mentioned any more as part of Cluster 4. NGI programmes have shown their strength and importance to supporting the European software infrastructure, as a generic funding instrument to fund digital commons and ensure their long-term sustainability. We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover when NGI has proven efficient and economical to support free software as a whole, from the smallest to the most established initiatives. This ecosystem diversity backs the strength of European technological innovation, and maintaining the NGI initiative to provide structural support to software projects at the heart of worldwide innovation is key to enforce the sovereignty of a European infrastructure. Contrary to common perception, technical innovations often originate from European rather than North American programming communities, and are mostly initiated by small-scaled organisations. Previous Cluster 4 allocated 27 million euros to: “Human centric Internet aligned with values and principles commonly shared in Europe” ; “A flourishing internet, based on common building blocks created within NGI, that enables better control of our digital life” ; “A structured ecosystem of talented contributors driving the creation of new internet commons and the evolution of existing internet commons”. In the name of these challenges, more than 500 projects received NGI funding in the first 5 years, backed by 18 organisations managing these European funding consortia. NGI contributes to a vast ecosystem, as most of its budget is allocated to fund third parties by the means of open calls, to structure commons that cover the whole Internet scope - from hardware to application, operating systems, digital identities or data traffic supervision. This third-party funding is not renewed in the current program, leaving many projects short on resources for research and innovation in Europe. Moreover, NGI allows exchanges and collaborations across all the Euro zone countries as well as “widening countries”, currently both a success and an ongoing progress, likewise the Erasmus programme before us. NGI also contributes to opening and supporting longer relationships than strict project funding does. It encourages implementing projects funded as pilots, backing collaboration, identification and reuse of common elements across projects, interoperability in identification systems and beyond, and setting up development models that mix diverse scales and types of European funding schemes. While the USA, China or Russia deploy huge public and private resources to develop software and infrastructure that massively capture private consumer data, the EU can’t afford this renunciation. Free and open source software, as supported by NGI since 2020, is by design the opposite of potential vectors for foreign interference. It lets us keep our data local and favors a community-wide economy and know-how, while allowing an international collaboration. This is all the more essential in the current geopolitical context: the challenge of technological sovereignty is central, and free software allows to address it while acting for peace and sovereignty in the digital world as a whole. In this perspective, we urge you to claim for preserving the NGI programme as part of the 2025 funding programme.

    "c": "Time to choose a new password? by Ty Myrddin Published on February 24, 2023 Image credit: Xkcd Currently perceived state Maintaining security demands ever longer, complex passwords with frequent changes, now augmented by installing and using multifactor authentication (MFA), with all passwords encrypted in transit and either encrypted or hashed at rest, and further augmented with biometrics. And we're all using it to protect our PII. Really? The elephant in the room In 2019, Microsoft found 44 million of its users had used the same password on more than one account. According to a 2019 Google study , almost two-thirds of people use the same password across multiple accounts. And apparently, IT professionals reuse passwords more than average users. They have, of course, more accounts to log into than the average user. The most popular passwords are extremely easy to guess. A lot of people use their name or birthdate in their password. The 2019 HYPR study revealed that lots of people rely on memory to manage their work passwords. Also, in 2020, according to The Ponemon State of Password and Authentication Security Behaviors Report , a little less than half of organisations still rely on sticky notes for password management. And share their password with someone else, even their email account password. In the HYPR 2022 report , 80% of reported breaches are due to authentication weaknesses, yet 90% believe their authentication approach is secure, and 63% kept their insecure authentication methods after a breach. More than half of users would prefer an alternative method to passwords. People are frustrated with passwords and just wish for the simplest access possible, instead of having to carry a cognitive burden, and having to jump through hoops all the time to keep their PII safe and secure. Future developments All passwords and passphrases will be obsolete. This is not unlikely to happen: The increase in affordable computing power provided by the cloud is not only providing companies application resources, but also providing adversaries with more password-cracking resources. Meanwhile, users continue to choose weak passwords, and as a result, there is a strong push to support alternative identification and authentication mechanisms . Mechanisms going beyond something one knows (password) and/or something one possesses (phone, fob) and/or even what one is (fingerprint, retinal print). Maybe we'll be using who one is, in the form of episodic memory because who are we but the stories we tell (ourselves), or in the form of our thoughts , because \"I think therefor I am\" ...

Fuck you over real hard and rough like, savvy? Often defined as “data about data,” metadata is information about a specific file that’s often included within the file itself but that’s often not readily visible or modifiable to the end-user when z is viewing the file in the standard application that z would typically use to view the file. In other words, metadata provides background information about a file. Chances are that every document you create, every digital photograph you take, every music file you download, and so on, all have little bits of metadata which can leak vital information about your identity. ~ The dangers of metadata, 2008 Surveillance and censorship go hand in hand, what else would surveillance be for other than to keep subjects obedient. Surveillance is carried out by just about everybody, parents, teachers, neighbours, organised private groups, corporations and governments, and we are not helpless, we can avoid surveillance as best as we can.

    "c": "General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by Ty Myrddin Published on April 15, 2018 The old Data Protection Directive of 1995 was outdated. It failed to cover for example, social networking sites, cloud computing, location-based services, smart cards and biometric data, and in 2012 the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the EU’s data protection rules to strengthen privacy rights and boost Europe’s digital economy. Unlike directives, the GDPR does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation. It is directly binding and applicable. All seven principles governing the OECD’s recommendations for protection of personal data are incorporated into the new EU regulation. Personal data Article 4(1) defines “personal data” as follows: ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person; This definition is broad and fairly all-encompassing. It includes any information relating to an identified individual (which makes such information personal to that individual), or any information relating to someone who could be identified based on a variety of identifiers. Controllers and processors Article 4 defines data controllers and data processors as follows: (7) ‘controller’ means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law; and (8) ‘processor’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller; Lawfulness of processing conditions Data processing must be “lawful”, meaning it must be justified by a legitimate purpose in order to be permissible. For “legitimate interests” the interests that are important to a business or organisation are not enough. These conditions must include Consent of the data subject Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject or to take steps to enter into a contract Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of a data subject or another person Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller Necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests, rights or freedoms of the data subject. Note that this condition is not available to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. Biometric data It defines biometric data as special categories of personal data and prohibits its processing, thereby protecting people from having their information shared with third parties without their consent. Biometric data are: _“personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allows or confirms the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data”. _ Conditions for processing special categories of data Processing of special categories of data for the purpose of \"uniquely identifying a natural person\" is prohibited, but it contains some exceptions. Explicit consent of the data subject, unless reliance on consent is prohibited by EU or Member State law Processing is necessary for carrying out obligations under employment, social security or social protection law, or a collective agreement Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of a data subject or another individual where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent Processing carried out by a not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim provided the processing relates only to members or former members (or those who have regular contact with it in connection with those purposes) and provided there is no disclosure to a third party without consent Processing relates to personal data manifestly made public by the data subject Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or where courts are acting in their judicial capacity Processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of Union or Member State law which is proportionate to the aim pursued and which contains appropriate safeguards Processing is necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine, for assessing the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or a contract with a health professional Processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of healthcare and of medicinal products or medical devices Processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, or scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes The right to be forgotten The Regulation states that consent must be explicit before the collection of the data. As in, users must be opted-out by default and be provided with an opt-in, instead of default be opted-in (often without their knowledge) and then have to search for an opt-out. Also, “the data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time”.​ Data breaches must be notified within 72 hours If a company or organisation discovers a data breach, then processors must inform the authorities within 72 hours of discovery. Companies managing biometric information can be hit with penalties if they do not make efforts to secure that data. Big penalties. Data protection by design and by default The Article 25 Data Protection by Design (DPbD) seeks to embed privacy protection at every level from conception to deployment. DPbD is not only about technological design. It extends to IT systems, accountable business practices, and physical design and networked infrastructure. This integrated approach is “an important factor in avoiding falling into techno-centric solutions to a sociotechnical problem.” In usual engineering practice, legal issues are considered obstacles to be overcome after a novel IT solution has been built and is to be rolled out. DPbD uses a reversed approach, whereby systems and processes are conceived and developed with privacy protection at their core. Legitimate interest Under the old directive that aimed to regulate data correlation, not just data collection, it was illegal to process personal data without a “legitimate interest”, and that legal basis was unavailable to data brokers (Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests of the data controller under Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC). Now, Recital 47 - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - Overriding legitimate interest* states: ”[t]he processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest“ . Can the data industry rely on legitimate interests or is it required to obtain consent despite the absence of a relationship with the data subjects? Under the GDPR, the legal basis for...",

A circular prison with a single guard tower in the middle was the original blueprint for the structure. It seems we have created some heterarchical form of panopticon on the internet, where just about everybody is spying on everybody else from behind sunglasses and masks. In particular big data corporations and nation states seem very busy with that, in very organised and automated ways. Hack-all-around-you, surveillance, and de-anonymisation seem to have become common practice (and competition). Machine learning (ML) is a key component in technologies such as predictive analytics and artificial intelligence. The Computer seems to be running the show. Most of the current AI offerings on the market can identify associations in large quantities of data, but can not work out complex phenomena of cause and effect or identify modifiable factors that can engender desired outcomes. Yet. I don’t know what is more dangerous, a world run by Black Rock ’s Aladdin -like machines as if they can, or development of machines that actually can and then making ourselves dependent on these even more. ML is used to review large volumes of data and identify patterns and trends. An error, for example a faulty sensor generating a flawed data set, can cause rippling effects within a machine learning interface, because events after the error may be flawed, skewed or just plain undesirable. Errors do occur, and it is a susceptibility that developers have thus far been unable to premeditate and negate consistently. Imagine, if people were to rely on these patterns and trends?!?

    "c": "Pave the way for distributed clouds on premises by Ty Myrddin Published on November 07, 2024 Steampunk airship fleet by Greg Hildebrandt, Vladimir Kush, Gediminas Pranckevicius, Erik Johansson, and Peter Mohrbacher Current trends Virtualisation solutions and moving data, computational, and software capabilities to the cloud drives for example, cloud-native and serverless applications. Its adoption signifies that centralisation of software and hardware resources in the hyperscale data centres allows for energy aware storage solutions like using Solid-State Drives for data needing high transfer speeds and long-term backup storage solutions for the rest of the data . Data centres can also use solar and wind farms , which is less likely an option for smaller organisations. Detection and shutdown of idle servers can also easily be done centrally to save energy. Most of all, the cloud enables use on demand of resources and geolocation for bringing a service near its end-points now. Development of Integrated infrastructures concerns dedicated sustainable hardware for software development, and includes domain specific hardware. Near future Edge computing is a distributed model that brings some computational tasks and data storage closer to the user (as source of data and as consumer). It can range from static mini-clouds on premises to flexible follow-the-need services via onboard computing and distributed networks of computational nodes. Originally developed with IoT applications in mind, mini-clouds on premises can be perceived as an intermediate step towards a completely distributed paradigm following and supporting the ongoing trend in decentralised energy production and smart energy grids. This then can allow for better profiling of energy consumption patterns and data usage patterns. AI computational tasks are very energy greedy. Trends such as federated learning algorithms, data compression of curated data, and approximate computing help reduce energy consumption, and perhaps there will be data-centric green AI techniques . Especially worth mentioning is sustainability-aware self-adaptation , using decision maps. What all three need is further research, academic and industrial eduction, additional learning paths, and most of all, an attitude towards responsibility for sustainable solutions created by design. Designs will likely first focus on reuse and hardware lifecycle management for creating longer lasting and better maintainable hardware, at a trade-off for being able to adopt new types of hardware when they become available. The far future? High power usage in computing caused by the von Neumann bottleneck is a significant sustainability issue, and Non-von Neumann architectures promise solutions for sustainable and energy-efficient nodes, especially at the edge layer. Photonic integrated circuits have already enabled fast artificial neural networks. Photonics can perhaps piggy-back on distributed paradigms. Problems Awareness creation requires monitoring and communicating environmental impacts and a behavioural change in data consumption patterns, and is a big problem because there is not enough digital spine (yet) . Real progress requires shared responsibility and accountability by all involved in all value chains. A very big ask. Unclear use, business, and communal cases and little activating legislation like dynamic pricing on real-time energy demands, make such changes very hard. Especially unclear are the effects on provision quality, energy savings, and the developments in the evolution of technology ecosystems, for example for federated mini-clouds on premises. A spine could help. These issues are complex and are thought to need to be solved on an international level first. This can take decades, if it happens at all. People don't like change. Really? People LOVE change, IF coming in the right proportion, at the right time and in the right way. If a proposed change is not being implemented, then the problem is with the change and not with people. Apparently there are not enough champions that have the decision power and budget to take the initiative and steer towards sustainability. There seems to be a perceived need for a coordinated change, sharing costs/risks and preventing compartmentalisation and silos. When using a large cloud provider, users give their power to make sustainability changes away to the provider. One just has to follow. In the context of federated mini-clouds, we can perhaps find sufficient champions in sustainability NGO's. What if ... What if, instead of going (only) top-down, we could also go bottom up in some small organisations, preferably with off-the-shelf open source Cloud solutions such as OpenStack , and work towards an on-premises cloud, and find some other like-minded organisations to share resources with to create a small distributed cloud. Then we can make guides, and include some of the monitoring, provision quality, and energy savings results giving similar other organisations more choices for their decisions on how to progress towards more sustainable set-ups. What if we can pave ways? Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for that very purpose.

    "c": "Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by Ty Myrddin Published on September 08, 2019 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights consists of 30 articles affirming an individual’s rights which, although not legally binding in themselves, have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties, economic transfers, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions, and other laws. The Declaration was the first step in the process of formulating the International Bill of Human Rights, which was completed in 1966, and came into force in 1976, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified them. Some legal scholars have argued that because countries have constantly invoked the Declaration for more than 50 years, it has become binding as a part of customary international law. Courts of several countries have concluded that the Declaration is not in and of itself part of domestic law. Article 12 No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. Article 25 Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection. Article 26 Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit. Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.

    "c": "Information war technology by Ty Myrddin Published on September 27, 2019 States are increasingly launching non-lethal attacks against an enemy’s information systems and people – this is the rise of information warfare. Not only is it a geopolitical “game”, states are also attacking their own people for maintaining dominance, corporations do to get you to buy their stuff, political groups are attacking other political groups for believing in something else, and individuals take out their frustration on others. Information warfare may involve collection of tactical information, assurance(s) that one’s own information is valid, spreading of propaganda or disinformation to demoralize or manipulate the enemy and the public, undermining the quality of opposing force information and denial of information-collection opportunities to opposing forces. Information warfare is closely linked to psychological warfare. In the big, and often also, in the small. Therefor researching the patterns of psychological warfare is easy. One can simply observe them in oneself and in ones own circles. For example, the myth of technological sufficiency that many depending on the system seem to believe in, identifies technology as the critical factor to solve any issue. Yet more technology is not likely to end any large scale (political) warfare. The new black bag is digital Over the past decade specially-trained CIA clandestine operators have mounted over one hundred extremely sensitive black bag jobs designed to penetrate foreign government and military communications and computer systems, as well as the computer systems of some of the world’s largest foreign multinational corporations. Spyware software has been secretly planted in computer servers; secure telephone lines have been bugged; fiber optic cables, data switching centres and telephone exchanges have been tapped; and computer backup tapes and disks have been stolen or surreptitiously copied in these operations. In other words, the CIA has become instrumental in setting up the shadowy surveillance dragnet that has now been thrown into public view. Sources within the U.S. intelligence community confirm that since 9/11, CIA clandestine operations have given the NSA access to a number of new and critically important targets around the world, especially in China and elsewhere in East Asia, as well as the Middle East, the Near East, and South Asia. ~ The CIA’s New Black Bag Is Digital, 2013 And it is not just the CIA, it resembles a panopticon in which all previously colonising countries are involved, to secure their continuity, intake of oil and rare earth elements, enhanced power and authority, status pursuit of ideological goals and objectives and general growth of their agency, marginalising entire populations of nation states with the assistance of local elites in the process. “Generations” of weapons “All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe that we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.” ~ Sixth generation warfare: manipulating space and time EMP weapons (electro-magnetic-pulse), HEMP (high altitude EMP), E-bombs (electromagnetic bombs), magnetic flux compression generator/microwave and/or radio-frequency radiation. 7GW? “Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the director of the opponent’s fate.” ~ Sun Tzu Information warfare is a concept involving the battlespace use and management of information and communication technology in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent. Information warfare is the manipulation of information trusted by a target without the target’s awareness so that the target will make decisions against their interest but in the interest of the one conducting information warfare. As a result, it is not clear when information warfare begins, ends, and how strong or destructive it is. Information warfare may involve the collection of tactical information, assurance(s) that one’s own information is valid, spreading of propaganda or disinformation to demoralize or manipulate the enemy and the public, undermining the quality of the opposing force’s information and denial of information-collection opportunities to opposing forces.

    "c": "Capturing credentials by Ty Myrddin Published on February 24, 2023 Image credit: Xkcd Some of the most common techniques adversaries use to capture credentials include finding or guessing credentials, and passing or relaying password hashes. Finding credentials Password storage targets on Windows after a compromise include operating system memory, user files such as Excel spreadsheets, and email inboxes and sent boxes, various system files like powershell history, the registry, and sticky notes. Attackers might try harvesting credentials stored in webserver configuration files and application files, operating system memory, a web browsers' autocomplete history or password manager, hard-coded in applications, and in cloud applications . The two most common ways for an adversary to intercept passwords is via an on-path attack , also known as Man in the Middle (MitM) attack, and via exploiting promiscuous protocols, such as LLMNR and NetBIOS, IPv6, and MDNS. An example of the first is poisoning Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables in a network switching device, getting it to forward traffic to an unauthorised port before being forwarded to its intended destination, waiting for a password hash, then pulling the hash offline for cracking it. Promiscuous protocols that can be tricked into sending a password hash to an unvetted recipient can result in a breach if the password is not long enough and is not difficult to guess . Guessing credentials Insecure web applications in general can be abused to bypass application access control lists (ACLs) or forge valid tokens. Adversaries confronted with a secure web application which does not leak platform, patch or configuration information; with code that protects against injection and scripting attacks; and with strong account access and lockout controls, may still try password guessing. Password lockout policies can sometimes be bypassed with password spraying . Passing or relaying password hashes The Windows NTLM algorithm algorithm is susceptible to the well-known pass-the-hash attack. Newer Windows authentication algorithms such as Net-NTLM hashes make use of a one-time challenge. But if message signing is not both enabled and required by every host in the domain, these challenges can be relayed by attackers. Relaying attacks can be done via cross-protocol relays that use any other protocol that supports Windows Net-NTLM authentication. Even Kerberos authentication , though more secure, can be successfully attacked. In some cases, Kerberos can be abused to impersonate other users within the environment and forge a valid ticket. And social engineering is still one of the most effective ways adversaries can use. Phishing seems to be the most popular choice. These attacks use persuasion techniques such as impersonating technical support personnel, name-dropping a person of authority, communicating a sense of urgency, and using plenty of technical jargon and alphabet soup to confuse users and elicit compliance. \"For verification purposes, please give us the code we just sent to you.\" Bypassing MFA The easiest way to bypass MFA is to social engineer. Another way could be to look for configurations that allow authentication that bypasses MFA, like application programming interfaces (APIs) or clients who do not require MFA, such as Exchange Web Services and Exchange Modern Authentication, which can provide a non-2FA-protected backdoor login. MFA-protected user accounts may not yet have been set up. For the adversary, time to do so. This is not quiet though, as the original user gets locked out of their account and will sound the alarm. A common bypass technique is to use the hashed Windows NTLM password hash to access functionality not protected by MFA. And last but not least, MFA systems need a fallback plan, and any weaknesses in a fail-open plan can be exploited. Adding biometrics? Adding fingerprint on top? FaceID? What if you are sleeping and someone uses your biometrics to unlock the device? What if someone knocks you out? Impact People, and companies and nations of all sizes have to defend against multiple threat events like ransomware, attacks going after personally identifiable information (PII) and the associated identity theft and possible further compromise, and scenarios in nation-state-sponsored global cyberwarfare, including boots-on-the-ground warfare contexts that involve digital communications.

    "c": "Grey areas by Ty Myrddin Published on May 07, 2021 The creation of legal grey areas, per three examples, using the example of sexual consent for clarity and because that is where the “consent” concept originated and is expanding from in everyday life for digital consent. Sexual consent I don’t think “sexual consent” exists other than as a legal term. If I “consent”, it means “I voluntarily agree to engage in a certain sexual activity”. Further, let’s assume I had both the freedom and capacity to consent, then the question is whether I agree to the activity by choice, not by coercion or force. A grey area. If the other person “did not reasonably believe” that I consented and continued to engage in sexual behaviour despite me saying “no”, he or she committed a sexual offence. This makes rape victims the key element in the issues surrounding consent and where common notions of victim-blaming often come into play: “The clothing she wore was an invitation”, “She was drunk”, “We live together”, and “We’ve had sex before”, etc. As far as I know, wearing clothes, having a drink, living together with someone, or having mutually consenting sex, are not criminal activities. Ofcourse there are those who want pleasurable and mutual consensual sexuality to move away from the old “no means no” mindset towards the concept of “affirmative consent”: “yes means yes” because it promises more “pushing of will”. Affirmative consent is not just about getting permission, but about making sex based on mutual desire and enthusiasm. A wonderful ideal to strive for. But re-inventing the wheel by using “yes means yes” instead of “no means no” does not remove the grey area. With ‘yes means yes’ we imply that every person has the power to say what they truly want when it comes to consent. This ignores the reality that people say ‘yes’ sometimes out of fear, and sometimes as a result of coercion . How about no forcing of will or coercion to push will on others, period. General Data Protection Regulation Digital consent follows similar patterns. The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is, in summary, a series of protocols that creates rules for businesses in Europe on how to process and maintain data collected from European residents. At first glance, the GDPR champions the rights of and consent of everyday internet users and targets a supposed grey-area black hat tactics that have exploited unsuspecting people browsing the internet. But it wasn’t a grey area, it was a black area, and by regulating the collection of data it actually legitimises the processing and maintenance of data from European residents and creates a grey area in which users can give consent or opt-in or opt-out, and have to apply to have their data removed and/or to be forgotten. Hours after the GDPR came into force users were confronted with consent-or-be-gone types of messages and large suits against Facebook and Google appeared, accusing them of “coercing” users into accepting their data collection policies. And as a “side note”, the legislation was purely for the private sector in order to “protect the public”. What about the public institutions funded by taxes from the people that are protected under the GDPR? What impact does the GDPR have on governing institutions? What do governments in Europe have to do because of the GDPR? Apparently nothing: “under EU law, the right to privacy and the right to protection of personal data are two distinct fundamental human rights.” The European Parliament distances itself from national authorities collecting and processing citizens private data by allocating all such activities to the nation alone, The Court of Justice of the EU does not have jurisdiction over cases that involve surveillance conducted by national authorities in order to safeguard the internal security of the EU Members. How about no collection of data, period. Federated Learning of Cohorts Third-party cookies are gradually going extinct now that many browsers block them, but that doesn’t mean Google (and similar others) will respect our privacy. Google started an experiment called FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts). It runs in Google’s Chrome browser and tracks a user’s online behaviour. Supposedly FLoC will allow personalized ads without the collection of data that can be tied to specific people. By assigning each browser an anonymised ID and then adding that ID into a large group, a cohort, where only the overall patterns are accessible to advertisers, the idea is that our privacy will remain intact, while Google and its advertising partners use it for widespread tracking and personalisation of ads. Marshall Vale, the product manager of Google’s privacy sandbox: “Before a cohort becomes eligible, Chrome analyzes it to see if the cohort is visiting pages with sensitive topics, such as medical websites or websites with political or religious content, at a high rate. If so, Chrome ensures that the cohort isn’t used, without learning which sensitive topics users were interested in.” Sounds awesome, but what is really happening and possible in this grey area? A user’s browser, a tool to interact with the internet, is supposed to be sacred. FLoC turns it into a real-time tracking tool collecting the most sensitive information about an individual user’s browsing habits without the user being able to circumvent or opt out of this data collection. And when the FLoC data set is big enough, deanonymisation will become easy . For example, cohorts of users sharing the same location data, shopping in the same neighbourhood, being active in the same time zone, can easily be grouped together by demographics, and if the data is combined with other tracking mechanisms such as social media analytics or data sets purchased from data brokers , fingerprinting users based on age, class, ethnicity, political parties becomes trivial. Google announced that in Chrome version 89 they will forcibly enable and trial their FLoC data-collection initiative without the consent of users or webmasters. Our options are reduced to “You either have old tracking or new tracking”, but you are going to get it anyway? Not entirely, because users and webserver adminstrators and webmasters can jump through hoops, again. It is annoying, very annoying, these constant attacks on our privacy.

    "c": "Defendable internet? by Ty Myrddin Published on February 2, 2023 David Clark can remember exactly when he was confronted with the Internet's dark side. Presiding over a meeting of network engineers, news broke that a dangerous computer worm was crawling through the wires. November 2, 1988, using the Internet's essential open nature, the first worm crashed 6000 machines, then one-tenth of the Internet. Those who developed this early network further, focused on the technical challenges of moving information quickly and reliably. They did not focus on how you could wreck this system intentionally, claiming online crime and aggression are the manifestation of basic human needs and wants, beyond easy technological solutions. Decades later, in 2023, the threats seem to be exploding. The targets for destruction have leapt from computers to banks, retailers, government agencies, critical mechanical systems in dams, power plants and aircraft, mobile apps and phones, clouds, our private data. Adversaries seem to be winning. Most likely because they have the luxury to focus only on the technical aspects of their work, while defenders have to navigate complex political and regulatory environments . If defenders did not have to deal with such issues, they could maybe focus on how to redesign the Internet to make it an open, transparent, and yet secure internet for all to enjoy. And with enough funding ofcourse. Thomas Dullien and Halvar Flake also explored why we are not building such a defendable internet : who is motivated by who to do what - and how these incentives fail to produce the security level we desire. Five years later, at Black Hat Europe 2022, the question returns, with an answer raising more questions: A defendable internet is possible, but only with industry makeover . A makeover which is unlikely to happen, as are all the other make-overs needed, for example for closing inequality gaps to bring a more just economical balance to the world, and a makeover for substantially reducing the effect we humans are having on the environment, other species, and next generations. I have some questions on this \"dark side\", by which I mean the \"ignored impacts on others and the future\": Are the minds of those that feel like they are \"the winners\" locked into \"winning\", pretty much like drug addicts get \"locked in\" on the next shot/drink? Does short term thinking rule the mind of those \"up top\"? Does the \"now\" command more attention than effects on the future? Is it a legacy replacement problem? We know *that* one. The continuous putting out fires leaves no time for replacement efforts (until it is all burned down and there is nothing left to replace but some ashes). Why is it difficult to look beyond the next news cycle/catastrophe/breach? If time can be sliced, is it only getting finer, with ever-shorter periods shaping our (digital) world? Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for that very purpose.

    "c": "Exploding hand-helds by Ty Myrddin Published on Sept 25, 2024 Cartoon by Joe Heller: Exploding pagers So what happened The first round of blasts began in Lebanon's capital Beirut and several other areas of the country at about 15:30 local time on Tuesday 17 september 2024 involving pagers. Another round of blasts, now from walkie-talkies, happened on Wednesday the 18th, at around 17:00 local time. Some of the pagers used by Hezbollah are models that run on lithium-ion batteries , which can cause dangerous explosions. According to information obtained by LBCI , the pager server can have been compromised, leading to the installation of a script that caused an overload. This then could have resulted in the overheating of the lithium battery, which then exploded. But it is unlikely that a regular pager battery alone can produce blasts that can injure multiple people (as was seen in some of the recorded attacks). It seems more likely the pagers were interdicted and modified with explosives. Interdiction Using so-called \"interdiction\", the target hardware is intercepted while on route to a next supplier in the supply chain. The hardware must be unpackaged, modified, repackaged and put back in the chain without raising red flags. Using \"Seeding\" is probably even harder, because the manipulation happens on the factory floor. Access in both cases can be gained by social engineering, like posing as officials, bribery, threatening an insider, etcetera. Hardware supply chain attacks are extremely hard to defend from . Once the hardware is successfully modified, adversaries can use the back door to gain further access or exfiltrate data, it is difficult to detect and fix, and gives long-term access. It is entirely possible that explosives planted in the pagers were detonated using a remote command, perhaps hidden in a pager message. But erm? there is not much space in the devices. Which explosives were that then? Targeting costs To make it a targeted attack the attacker would need an operative to make sure the modified devices are delivered to the targets and not just anyone. This requires a mole, or a bribe. And time. How long does it take to infiltrate Hezbollah providers to the point of delivering hundreds of devices? Why this attack? Buying time? Replacing a large number of pagers will take time. Deterrence? The first round came just hours after Israel's security cabinet made the safe return of residents to the north of the country an official war goal. Showing the depth of Israel's intelligence pockets might deter Hezbollah. Amos Yadlin , a former head of Israeli military intelligence, said the Israeli attack displayed \"very impressive penetration capabilities, technology and intelligence.\" The deterrence factor however, does not seem to be working. Did anyone else notice the use of the word \"penetration\"? What on Earth do they think they are doing? And it is not a surprise either. Similar capabilities were already shown. Still, the scale of this attack seems \"unprecedented\". As mp wrote: \"In other words, it seems to me, this action is only really possible (\"easy\") if you are already deeply invested in the dark arts of arms trafficking and dealing, which is to say: embedded in the global, criminal economy. It is statecraft.\" Western response There are UN accusations that this constitutes a war crime, as well as congratulations on the ingenuity of the attack, while it injured at least 2800 people and killed at least nine. But not really an outcry. I have not seen a real outcry on what is happening in Gaza either, by the way. Have we gone numb because of all the war and killing ? The best explanation I have seen is from Patrice: \"In general, I think there is by now a weariness to address the increasingly dystopian aspect of tech, wether it's corporate or military developed and deployed, since (i) it makes one very depressive (ii) it won't help anyway\" Historically, technological advances are double-edged swords. Technology has been used against us, while claimed to have been designed to help us. Such opportunism rules mankind. What if our governments are taken over by less-democratic forces? If hand-held devices, such as walkie-talkies or pagers, can be implanted with explosives and can kill targets, how safe are any of us from this mode of attack? Posting this is also unlikely to help, but I feel slightly better. Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for that very purpose.

For example, the escape sequence ' ' can represent a newline character, and '\\t' a tab. But if a backslash is followed by an invalid character, it raises a warning. In general, a warning does not halt program execution, but it is essential to address these warnings, as they can indicate potential issues with the code. Ignoring these warnings can lead to unintended consequences, such as incorrect string formatting, unexpected behaviour, or even security vulnerabilities.

    "c": "Governmental ghost stories by Ty Myrddin Published on February 17, 2020 This old-fashioned horror anthology isn’t terrifying or scream-inducing; instead, it’s closer in spirit to the moody, clammy, atmospheric English movies of decades past, and parodies thereof. I am again reminded of Dr. Strangelove. The UK Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) Beginning of 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK’s Snooper’s Charter is unlawful . In 2018, Australia’s parliament passed legislation that allows intelligence and law enforcement agencies to demand access to encrypted communications data. And the GCHQ now wantsss that preciousss information too. Secure messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and iMessage can be forced to create backdoors or to operate a “ghost protocol” that “CC’s” an encrypted message to a third-party when it is sent. A state run Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)?!? The ghastly ghostly proposal from GCHQ was made late 2018 by its director Ian Levy, and involved “silently adding a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call”, according to the “Principles for a More Informed Exceptional Access Debate” article written by Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson. The Letter Then a coalition of 47 organisations and individuals wrote to the GCHQ, raising objections to the proposal to insert privileged users in encrypted conversations, in order for the government to spy on such interactions without actually breaking encryption. The GCHQ “ghost protocol” would seriously undermine user security and trust. O Really?!? And while I do think it is an excellent idea to bring it to the table, among the signets are also Apple and Facebook’s WhatsUp. Ironically, Facebook is the biggest and worst example of how business models arrogate and appropriate data about us, read all our emails, comments, and other things we put online and behind the scenes with friends, family, business connections, in order that this content might be tied into our profiles and make us easier targets for their paying customers – the advertisers and marketers of big and small organisations – to drill down into our inner desires and close that all important sale. And Apple continues to give the impression it thinks privacy is worth fighting for, even if only as a business Unique Selling Point. The intrusive activities and long-term business models of “data science” are Silicon Valley’s very own(ed) ghost protocol.

    "c": "Five Eyes alliance by Ty Myrddin Published on August 28, 2018 The UKUSA agreement, first called the BRUSA Agreement, was signed in March 1946 for cooperation in signals intelligence between the UK and the USA. It was extended to include Canada in 1948 and Australia and New Zealand in 1956. It was a secret agreement until 1999 when it was disclosed by the Australian Defence Signals Directorate. Nowadays, it’s called the Five Eyes (FVEY). On June 25, 2010, the agreement was (partially) disclosed by Britain and the United States . The UK link requires payment. This repository is a complete collection of all documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden that have subsequently been published by news media around the world. Created to share signals intelligence between allies, the agreement was intended to streamline the collection and analysis of intercepted data and communications. There is thought to be around 130 known listening stations worldwide. Some are huge, such as Britain’s Menwith Hill complex, and some are small or even “internet of things”-size small and function automatically. The agreement standardises terminology, codes, clearances, handling procedures and access to facilities. An exchange of personnel appears common. Governments of the UKUSA members have been careful to seem to restrain their agencies from spying on their own citizens in politician and watchdog words and very clear laws, but nothing keeps the other members of the agreement from spying on their partners’ citizens and handing over that information as part of the intelligence sharing agreement. Not only that, apparently intelligence agencies are above such laws, and the laws are updated, upgraded and adapted to the actual capacities of intelligence agencies, not the other way around.

The GDPR for example, actually legitimises the entire information industry by making it a grey area . It came into force May 25 at midnight 2018 and is supposed to give users a free choice, whether they agree to data usage or not. The opposite feeling spread on the screens of many users: tons of “consent boxes” popped up online or in applications, often combined with a threat that the service can no longer be used if users do not consent. On the first day of GDPR noyb.eu filed four complaints against Google (Android), Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram over “forced consent”. Politics no longer seems to be able to cope with six of the greatest challenges of our time: destruction of the environment, digitalisation, the power of algorithms, systematic lies in politics, unchecked globalisation and threats to the rule of law. We all want to live in an environment that is healthy and protected. We want to use the internet in a way determined by us, without being scrutinised and manipulated, we want to be able to trust intelligent machines and not be threatened by them.

    "c": "Internet (in)security trends by Ty Myrddin Published on April 22, 2021 “Gotta feel kind of bad for nation-state hackers who spend years implanting and cultivating some hardware exploit, only to discover the entire target database is already exposed to anyone with a web browser.” Most E2EE are secure against only the weakest passive adversaries, breakable not by cryptanalysis of underlying cryptographic algorithms but by flawed system designs and security assumptions. Unencrypted metadata and access patterns make these systems susceptible to inference attacks. And recently made laws seem to have been made to prepare the way for agencies to legitimately gather encrypted data via backdoors and ghost protocols. The MitM server-to-server HTTPS communication attack for example, is not about a vulnerability, it is about a flawed concept. The abstraction of trusted Internet routing is wrong. DNSsec and IPsec routing were developed as stopgaps, but make packet flow harder to troubleshoot and add excessive administrative overhead. Hackers increasingly use search engine poisoning attacks because they are so easy to do, and several automated tool-kits are readily available to make it even easier. Credential stuffing is currently one of the most common techniques used to take-over user accounts. Credential spilling is when credentials gained from data breaches are sold to other adversaries. Credential stuffing is the large scale use of automated means to test stolen passwords against other unrelated websites. This is a possible and often successful attack because of the tendency for users to recycle their passwords for multiple accounts. Polymorphic malware created by machines are likely to develop (further). These learn to evade detection based on automated vulnerability detection and complex data analysis. DDoS and DrDoS attacks employ swarms of these vulnerable endpoints to attack public infrastructure through massively coordinated communication channels. Smarter control software exists but is costly, and certainly not available to consumer-grade endpoints. Think unpredictable spikes in infrastructure use and availability issues. Meanwhile, such poorly-protected vulnerable endpoints are ubiquitous and provide starting points for further structured attacks. And there is more to come. Mobile devices and connected sensors such as smart home devices, biochip transponders on farm animals and electric clams in coastal waters, you name it, the monitoring craze is everywhere, increasing the attack surface.

Teaching The Montessori philosophy offers a holistic approach to education that recognizes the innate potential and dignity of every individual. The autonomy, self-directed learning, and respect for the individual are principles which have far-reaching implications beyond traditional educational settings. Experiential Learning Theory, is a widely recognized and influential framework that describes how people learn through experience. People can use hands-on learning processes for all forms of learning. Digital defence @home This project is about understanding the landscape and securing @home (and @smallorganisational) contexts as good as we can ourselves. The approach is to pick the raisins out of the commercial porridge. What makes sense in our respective contexts? IPA Project A project, together with Meltem Arikan, sponsored by /ut7 for supporting Intimate Partner Abuse survivors in various (digital) ways. Digital defence @home IPA Project Facilitation Facilitation is the craft of guiding a group or individual through a participatory process that makes it easier to achieve their goals. Systems thinking Systems thinking expands the range of choices available for solving a problem by broadening our thinking and helping us phrase problems in new and other ways. The principles of systems thinking can make us aware that there are no flawless solutions and that the choices we make will have an impact on other parts of the system. By anticipating the impact of trade-offs, we can minimize the impacts or even use them to our advantage. As a result, systems thinking allows us to make better informed and less damaging choices. Systems thinking, in particular causal loop diagrams can be used to tell compelling stories describing how a system works. Retrospectives Retrospectives are popular in the team-working world of the Lean and Agile community. The technique was inspired by the work of Virginia Satir. She developed a technique called the Daily Temperature Reading for keeping relationships healthy and happy. Reflecting on what has happened in the past (first the positive and then the negative) and then figuring out what to do in the future to improve. And with a bit of creativity it can be made fun and enjoyable to do. Looking forward Scenario planning originated in the U.S. military for making strategic decisions, to plan and prepare for various possible futures. Today, scenario planning is used by all kinds of organisations world-wide. Adding obliviousness and congruence awarenesses to scenario planning choreographies make it a more balanced experience and suitable for planning deductive and inductive paths to possible futures. Systems thinking example Satir Temperature Reading (pdf) Scenario logics example Software development Software Development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining computer programs and applications. C and C++ C and C++ are used for high performance and low-level control. It is suited for backend systems, computationally intensive processes, and applications that require precise memory control. Been there, done that in the stone age of computer science. At the moment not much to show, but for some snippets. Python Python is simple, versatile, and readable, and often used for web development, data analysis, and AI. It is perfect for frontend scripts, prototyping, data manipulation, and creating user-friendly APIs for C++-based backend systems. A lot of frameworks (25+) have been developed for Python, providing a structure for the code and a set of tools and features that streamline the development process. Examples are Flask and FastAPI. Python frameworks Flask is a lightweight micro-framework used to quickly build simple web applications. It includes support for Jinja templates (a way to reuse HTML code), request handling, and application signaling. Both FastAPI and Starlette are built on top of Uvicorn, which is an ASGI server, but they serve different purposes and offer distinct features that can impact performance. Starlette provides the foundational tools for building web applications. It is lightweight and optimized for speed, making it suitable for simple applications. FastAPI is built on top of Starlette, adding features like automatic data validation and serialization. AI Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undoubtedly revolutionizing numerous fields, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment. Its potential to enhance efficiency, solve complex problems, and drive innovation is enormous. So is its energy use. The rapid advancement and integration of AI into society also raises significant ethical, social, and technical concerns that warrant critical examination. Exploring the various AI techniques can support such research (see below threat modelling example). Reverse engineering Flask application on headless (Netlify) Typesense, Starlette Search engine (under construction) Various explorations in AI Security Threat modelling Threat modeling is the process of using hypothetical scenarios, system diagrams, and testing to help secure systems and data. Deanonymisation refers to the process of reversing the anonymisation of data, thereby revealing the identity of individuals who were previously anonymous. This practice has significant implications for privacy, security, and ethics, particularly in an era where vast amounts of data are collected, shared, and analyzed. Pentesting A vulnerability assessment focuses on scanning hosts for vulnerabilities as individual entities. Penetration tests might start by scanning for vulnerabilities just as a regular vulnerability assessment but pentesting gives more information on how an attacker can chain vulnerabilities to achieve specific goals. During pentesting, focus remains on identifying vulnerabilities and establishing measures to protect the network, but it also considers the network as a whole ecosystem and how an attacker could profit from interactions between its components. Red teaming Red teaming is a term borrowed from the military. In military exercises, the red team simulates attack techniques to test the reaction capabilities of a defending blue team against known adversary strategies. In cybersecurity, the red team emulates a real threat actor's Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for measuring how well the blue team responds and to test any security controls in place. Usually the blue team is made up of members of a security incident response team (SIRT) and/or security operations team (SOC) , but in a small organisation can consist of the systems administrator with interested parties. Red teaming does not replace penetration testing. It complements it by focusing on detection and response rather than prevention. Red teaming improves penetration testing by taking into account more attack...",

    "c": "Raising security awareness The usual suspects A lot of funds are spent on security equipment, firewalls, encryption, pentesting, red teaming, you name it. And if someone can walk out the door with files under their arm, or a manager signs off on a control which does not work, or if someone clicks on a link in a phishing email, the keys to the king or queendom may well be within reach of an adversary. Curiosities, biases, and susceptibilities, can all be potential gateways. The good news is, these very human traits can also be used to improve security. Confirmation bias can make people assume an attack is done by a specific threat actor. Confirming that looking at alternative scenarios, and actively challenging existing belief systems can work to improve security stances. Bandwagon bias leads to taking the road traveled by everyone else. How about jumping on the bandwagon of building more diverse teams, fostering critical thinking, and encouraging devil’s advocate perspectives? Hindsight bias can cause vulnerabilities to remain undiscovered, even with many eyes on the code. When such a vulnerability is found, we can apply hindsight bias to the hindsight bias, and learn about the dangers of this particular bias. People more and more gather information from reading articles the internet and sharing with colleagues, including on how hackers target cognitive biases. Anchoring bias can cause risks with low likelihood or low impact to be viewed as more likely to happen than they really are in a specific context. Drop the anchor in improving internal communication for determining raw risks and residual risks. Test driven efforts There is no way to measure the success of security awareness efforts unless the behaviours that need to change are (continuously) identified. Measuring raising security awareness success requires building an evaluation framework that uses communication, simulated events, event logging and monitoring, and assessments to test its effectiveness from multiple perspectives. And in organisational contexts, nothing will work if management does not create an environment in which people (can) trust leadership to be learning too. And then get going making security fun, growing security thinking, care and guts, while tracking progress from currently perceived state to the next desired state. Hands-on workshops Learning goes best when it is made fun, takes one day, is done off-site, and includes discussing experiences. Experiential learning is the process of learning through hands-on experience, building upon what one knows to expand that knowledge into action. It is one of the most beneficial types of learning because one gets out of an experience what one puts in, and allows people to better retain what is learned and can be used for raising awareness. That which was experienced can not be unexperienced. Simulations and roleplay After having done some experiential training, up next could be simulations set up for specific situations in specific contexts of the organisation. This can even go as far as colourful teaming where a red team and blue team play out imaginary attack and defense scenarios. Human-readable guides Just like in pentesting, reports and guides have to be adapted for specific audiences, without “talking down”. The term “human-readable” implies information that is meaningful for people and that can be comprehended quickly. I do try. The very best guides are produced by and for people (in an organisation), after an experience making them the domain experts, after a hands-on exercise, or after a simulation.

    "c": " No instant transportation Digital security is a fascinating field to work in; it is not the good guys vs bad guys, white hats vs gray hats vs black hats, or about computer science, math and teaching degrees (although I have them). Technical knowledge is important, but that is just logic. A love for puzzling, not being afraid of new experiences, a lifetime of learning, understanding what makes people tick, and supporting others , will give better results. Never Up To Date People's devices, their data, and people themselves can be at risk. We need to prevent, find, and fix these vulnerabilities, before an attacker takes advantage. I do not assume I know it all, nor that which was valid yesterday, will be valid today. I keep researching and learning, and can transfer the knowledge and skills I do keep and make sense in context, and bring positive attitudes to the table. With Love Working with threats and threat modelling requires a paranoia mindset. A higher paranoia level makes it harder for an attacker to go undetected. It all depends on the possible impact what level of paranoia is needed. This can be unhealthy for our minds. I use humour. Laughing brings oxygen to the brain, which reduces the effects of paranoia. On top of that, an oxygenated mind is more relaxed and has a much greater capacity for clear thinking.

    "c": "Data retention legislation EU by Ty Myrddin Published on April 15, 2018 In two judgments, the Digital Rights Ireland case (2014) and the Tele-2/Watson decision (2016) , the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) reaffirmed the requirement that all data retention regimes must comply with the principles of legality, necessity, and proportionality. The Data retention legislation in Europe page lists how the national members states have reacted to the 2014 decision and if there is a constitutional complaint on the national data retention laws. The basic standard laid down by the CJEU is not adhered to by most EU member states, despite their legal obligation to comply with the Court’s jurisprudence.

Google Fonts The Landgericht München’s third civil chamber in Munich, found that a website, by including Google-Fonts-hosted font on its pages, passed the unidentified plaintiff’s IP address to Google without authorization and without a legitimate reason for doing so . This violates the GDPR. Google and Facebook Cookie consent CNIL, the French data protection regulator, has issued fines to Google and Facebook for making it harder to refuse cookies than to accept them . The CNIL noted that the websites facebook.com, google.fr, and youtube.com offer a button allowing the user to immediately accept cookies. But they do not provide an equivalent solution (button or other mechanism) enabling the website user to just as easily refuse the use of these cookies. Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) When users visit a website or application for the first time, an interface (a Consent Management platform or CMP) will pop up where the user may consent to the collection and sharing of their personal data, or object to various types of processing based on the legitimate interests of ad tech vendors. The TCF facilitates the capture of the users’ preferences which are then shared with the organisations using the Open Real Time Bidding system . The Belgian data protection authority (APD) determined that IAB Europe acts as a data controller for the registration of individual users’ preferences by means of the Transparency and Consent String, linked to an identified user. As such, it finds IAB Europe in violation of the GDPR with its pop-up consent system which is used by companies to make ads and online tracking compliant with the GDPR. The decision has implications for the entire online ad industry, as data collected through the system must now be deleted. Google Analytics Google Analytics provides statistics on website traffic. After receiving complaints from the NOYB association, the CNIL analysed the conditions under which the data collected through this service is transferred to the United States.

    "c": "Legitimisation patterns by Ty Myrddin Published on October 13, 2020 Legitimate power is based on a structural relationship (or rather the acceptance of economic stratification or other forms of hierarchy) between the influencing agent and the target. Implicitly, or explicitly, the agent says, “I have a right (the position) to ask you to do this and you have an obligation (the position) to comply”. When words like “obliged” or “obligated”, “should”, “ought to”, “must”, and “are required to” are used, they may signal an attempt at “legitimisation of power” (which even if accepted by a society, may not be considered lawful in more common sense perceptions or by a questioning individual). Legitimacy can be understood as a capital of recognition (Bourdieu). This symbolic capital makes a coercive force be accepted for whom it “suffers”. Power becomes authority when it possesses “capital of legitimisation”. However, bearing in mind that throughout political history of the West that capital of legitimacy has function and has been stated in diverse ways, this distinction between power and authority must take in the multiple and diverse forms in which both have been conceived. There are mainly three legitimacy paradigms that can synthesize the earlier mentioned history: the paradigm of difference, that of equality, and that of interdependency between difference and equality. Each one of these paradigms entails different ways of conceiving the legitimate power and the illegitimate power: within difference the legitimate power is the sacred force owned by the sovereign over the subordinate who lacks power (since the illegitimate power lacks formulation it can only be conceived as a resistant practice). within equality the legitimate power is the determination of the collection of equals (system, nation, society, …) over oneself, it is the self-created or emerging domain from a systemic collection of relations, while the illegitimate and subjective power splits up, fragments or scatters the whole, and at the same time progresses producing “illegitimacy”. within interdependence the power assimilates the tension between potential (possibility) and force in action, all power and all authority is conceived as disintegrating and subjective, a degree of recognition between different ones who do not give up difference and who recognize themselves on it as equally strongly linked in interdependency webs where the possibility of better balanced relationships appears.

    "c": "Scenario logics by Ty Myrddin Published on April 26, 2022, From a scenario planning done in 2013, with some of the measurables and observables that had appeared by 2022: Obliviousness and congruence Plot In scenario planning everything is a prediction. None of it is real. All predictions are wrong. And that which gets overlooked in most (if not all) digital scenarios is reality. For example: We belong to a finite planet, with finite resources. Likely effects Constraints on economic development (but not for transnational players in the neoliberal network). Corporations and businesses already show a trend of making employees make do with what they have and requests made by employees for better resources (to serve customers with) are ignored, leaving employees in a very difficult place – unable to do their job properly and on top of that, likely to be penalised for ‘poor performance’. This could lead to people feeling burned out and frustrated. Performance will drop as a result and so will demand and profits. Instead of dealing with it (just as with addicts facing a scarcity of the resource they are dependent on), over-use of resources, such as the depletion of rain forests and over-fishing can occur. Opportunism can increase. Misuse of scarce resources is also likely. The effect of inflation tends to be stronger for low-income individuals, whom inflation renders relatively more vulnerable, thereby increasing inequality. Lack of material resources - chronic (low income) and situational (inflation) lack of material resources - causes people to make harsher moral judgments and be more (often) physically ill. Measurables and observables Many of the metals needed to feed the surging global demand for high-tech products, from smartphones to solar panels, cannot be replaced, according to a Yale study, On the materials basis of modern society The British Geological Survey (BGS) Risk List states that economically important metals with high levels of risk to supply disruption including antimony (with application as a fire retardant), bismuth (used in numerous medical applications), platinum group metals (active components in auto-catalysts), and tungsten (a key hard metal used in most cutting tools), particularly the rare earth elements and antimony, have low recycling rates and a limited number of substitutes. They are also almost exclusively mined as by-product metals. The minimum total power that was required to run (wall socket power) and maintain (embody) the internet in 2017 was guesstimated to be somewhere between ~131 GW + ~167 GW = ~298 GW and ~204 GW + ~288 GW = ~492 GW. Surveillance society Plot A government steps in to protect its citizens from (potential) dissident and/or criminal actions and/or information that might “corrupt” its citizens. (Intelligence) Agencies use data-mining to identify (potential) individual dissidents and criminals. Government steps in to protect its individual citizens’ privacy from being mined by non-state-actors and to create distraction from their own mining activities. Strong privacy regulations emerge. Citizens are increasingly being targeted in surveillance with surveillance tools purchased from China. Likely effects Organisations (Cartels, corporations, companies, NGO’s) are restricted in their use of data. Consumerism is stifled. Governments will try to shift responsibility to individual citizens. Identity theft and ransomware boom. Individual citizens and citizen groups supported by NGO’s call for “making the internet more safe (for children/women/dissidents)”. Governments try to regulate again and surveillance increases. Companies offering private and protected access to online services and make a lot of money. Mobile devices are closed and curated. Because people need to appear perfect to others, the need to appear perfect to oneself increases also (the cognitive dissonance is too painful). Acknowledging mistakes and failures and the feelings associated with them can be hard. The surveillance society makes people have “negative emotions”. The positive thinking movement encourages people to ignore their negative emotions. Negative emotions get buried in subconscious, resulting in mood swings, unexplained sadness, and mild depression, and eventually in aggression. Suppressing negative emotions may lead to depression, low self-esteem, and even physical illness in extreme cases. Suppressing emotions is a risk factor in premature death, including death from cancer. Negative emotions are dumped elsewhere on innocent people. NGO’s will need more funding to respond with new/more support for women and children (at home) and dissidents (elsewhere). Consciously constantly suppressing emotions can cause emotional numbness. It is common to hear the phrases “We live in stressful times” and “It is what it is” (with a shrug) and “You shouldn’t feel this way. Everything is alright. You need to be positive.” Measurables and observables The attack patterns may or may not have to do with psychogenic forces and deep states and include women and children more targeted more by teensy weensy petty tyrants, little petty tyrants and minor petty tyrants. human rights activists, journalists, land defenders, and political dissidents targeted more by petty tyrants. identity theft and ransomware attacks happening via automated botnets. (Intelligence) Agencies increasingly using data-mining or bying data from brokers to identify “(potential) individual dissidents and criminals”. The old EU Data Protection Directive of 1995 was outdated. It failed to cover for example, social networking sites, cloud computing, location-based services, smart cards and biometric data, and in 2012 the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the EU’s data protection rules to strengthen privacy rights and boost Europe’s digital economy. Unlike directives, the new GDPR that came into force in 2018 does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation. It is directly binding and applicable. Note that the GDPR only addresses privacy concerns related to data processing by private sector and not by individual Member States. With the internet being a global network (driven by established interests), laws regarding for example, digital fingerprinting by intelligence agencies, may develop completely differently from one country to another regardless of raised concerns at the EU level as to the compatibility of such activities with human rights standards. Interventions by governments Plot Corporations, enterprises and NGO’s are targets in this scenario. A government attempts to regulate the situation in order to protect the targets and itself. All infrastructure becomes critical. The targets are held responsible. Attacks are perceived as cyber war events. Cyber warfare breaks out. Likely effects Increased cost (capital) for businesses/organisations online. Increasingly business resources are focused on compliance with regulation instead of risk assessments for gaining a profit. Botnets get taken down. More cyber criminals are caught. Opportunity cost for private petty tyrants increases. Measurables and observables The attack patterns that the (in)famous Equifax (and other) data breaches reveal, is one of negligence - only self, no real concern for customers/clients/citizens and the context of the internet. This invites government regulation while such vulnerable products do not invite perceptions of sophisticated hacking on infrastructure by other nations and acts of cyberwar that call for counterattacks. On the contrary. The JP Morgan Chase hack is a prime example of immediately perceiving cyberwar after a breach is made known. When discovered in 2014, the media were full of articles on Russian hackers attacking the U.S. financial system in retaliation against U.S. government-sponsored sanctions aimed at Russia. As it turns out in 2015, it was a “worldwide hacking ring” with four members, of which one was an American and two were Israeli’s....",

    "c": "The European Union must keep funding free software by Ty Myrddin Published on July 22, 2024 Original: https://pad.public.cat/lettre-NCP-NGI , initially published by petites singularites , English translation provided by OW2 . If you want to sign the letter, please publish the letter on your website and complete the table below on this page . Open Letter to the European Commission Since 2020, Next Generation Internet (NGI) programmes, part of European Commission's Horizon programme, fund free software in Europe using a cascade funding mechanism (see for example NLnet’s calls). This year, according to the Horizon Europe working draft detailing funding programmes for 2025, we notice that Next Generation Internet is not mentioned any more as part of Cluster 4. NGI programmes have shown their strength and importance to supporting the European software infrastructure, as a generic funding instrument to fund digital commons and ensure their long-term sustainability. We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover when NGI has proven efficient and economical to support free software as a whole, from the smallest to the most established initiatives. This ecosystem diversity backs the strength of European technological innovation, and maintaining the NGI initiative to provide structural support to software projects at the heart of worldwide innovation is key to enforce the sovereignty of a European infrastructure. Contrary to common perception, technical innovations often originate from European rather than North American programming communities, and are mostly initiated by small-scaled organisations. Previous Cluster 4 allocated 27 million euros to: “Human centric Internet aligned with values and principles commonly shared in Europe” ; “A flourishing internet, based on common building blocks created within NGI, that enables better control of our digital life” ; “A structured ecosystem of talented contributors driving the creation of new internet commons and the evolution of existing internet commons”. In the name of these challenges, more than 500 projects received NGI funding in the first 5 years, backed by 18 organisations managing these European funding consortia. NGI contributes to a vast ecosystem, as most of its budget is allocated to fund third parties by the means of open calls, to structure commons that cover the whole Internet scope - from hardware to application, operating systems, digital identities or data traffic supervision. This third-party funding is not renewed in the current program, leaving many projects short on resources for research and innovation in Europe. Moreover, NGI allows exchanges and collaborations across all the Euro zone countries as well as “widening countries”, currently both a success and an ongoing progress, likewise the Erasmus programme before us. NGI also contributes to opening and supporting longer relationships than strict project funding does. It encourages implementing projects funded as pilots, backing collaboration, identification and reuse of common elements across projects, interoperability in identification systems and beyond, and setting up development models that mix diverse scales and types of European funding schemes. While the USA, China or Russia deploy huge public and private resources to develop software and infrastructure that massively capture private consumer data, the EU can’t afford this renunciation. Free and open source software, as supported by NGI since 2020, is by design the opposite of potential vectors for foreign interference. It lets us keep our data local and favors a community-wide economy and know-how, while allowing an international collaboration. This is all the more essential in the current geopolitical context: the challenge of technological sovereignty is central, and free software allows to address it while acting for peace and sovereignty in the digital world as a whole. In this perspective, we urge you to claim for preserving the NGI programme as part of the 2025 funding programme.

    "c": "Time to choose a new password? by Ty Myrddin Published on February 24, 2023 Image credit: Xkcd Currently perceived state Maintaining security demands ever longer, complex passwords with frequent changes, now augmented by installing and using multifactor authentication (MFA), with all passwords encrypted in transit and either encrypted or hashed at rest, and further augmented with biometrics. And we're all using it to protect our PII. Really? The elephant in the room In 2019, Microsoft found 44 million of its users had used the same password on more than one account. According to a 2019 Google study , almost two-thirds of people use the same password across multiple accounts. And apparently, IT professionals reuse passwords more than average users. They have, of course, more accounts to log into than the average user. The most popular passwords are extremely easy to guess. A lot of people use their name or birthdate in their password. The 2019 HYPR study revealed that lots of people rely on memory to manage their work passwords. Also, in 2020, according to The Ponemon State of Password and Authentication Security Behaviors Report , a little less than half of organisations still rely on sticky notes for password management. And share their password with someone else, even their email account password. In the HYPR 2022 report , 80% of reported breaches are due to authentication weaknesses, yet 90% believe their authentication approach is secure, and 63% kept their insecure authentication methods after a breach. More than half of users would prefer an alternative method to passwords. People are frustrated with passwords and just wish for the simplest access possible, instead of having to carry a cognitive burden, and having to jump through hoops all the time to keep their PII safe and secure. Future developments All passwords and passphrases will be obsolete. This is not unlikely to happen: The increase in affordable computing power provided by the cloud is not only providing companies application resources, but also providing adversaries with more password-cracking resources. Meanwhile, users continue to choose weak passwords, and as a result, there is a strong push to support alternative identification and authentication mechanisms . Mechanisms going beyond something one knows (password) and/or something one possesses (phone, fob) and/or even what one is (fingerprint, retinal print). Maybe we'll be using who one is, in the form of episodic memory because who are we but the stories we tell (ourselves), or in the form of our thoughts , because \"I think therefor I am\" ...

    "c": "Cracked: Surveillance architecture by Ty Myrddin Published on November 02, 2019 To put it bluntly, metadata is hidden data that can fuck you over. Fuck you over real hard and rough like, savvy? Often defined as “data about data,” metadata is information about a specific file that’s often included within the file itself but that’s often not readily visible or modifiable to the end-user when z is viewing the file in the standard application that z would typically use to view the file. In other words, metadata provides background information about a file. Chances are that every document you create, every digital photograph you take, every music file you download, and so on, all have little bits of metadata which can leak vital information about your identity. ~ The dangers of metadata, 2008 Surveillance and censorship go hand in hand, what else would surveillance be for other than to keep subjects obedient. Surveillance is carried out by just about everybody, parents, teachers, neighbours, organised private groups, corporations and governments, and we are not helpless, we can avoid surveillance as best as we can. Likewise, censorship can be carried out by everybody as well. And we can try to circumvent censorship as long as we also protect ourselves from prying eyes on what we are doing.

    "c": "General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by Ty Myrddin Published on April 15, 2018 The old Data Protection Directive of 1995 was outdated. It failed to cover for example, social networking sites, cloud computing, location-based services, smart cards and biometric data, and in 2012 the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the EU’s data protection rules to strengthen privacy rights and boost Europe’s digital economy. Unlike directives, the GDPR does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation. It is directly binding and applicable. All seven principles governing the OECD’s recommendations for protection of personal data are incorporated into the new EU regulation. Personal data Article 4(1) defines “personal data” as follows: ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person; This definition is broad and fairly all-encompassing. It includes any information relating to an identified individual (which makes such information personal to that individual), or any information relating to someone who could be identified based on a variety of identifiers. Controllers and processors Article 4 defines data controllers and data processors as follows: (7) ‘controller’ means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law; and (8) ‘processor’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller; Lawfulness of processing conditions Data processing must be “lawful”, meaning it must be justified by a legitimate purpose in order to be permissible. For “legitimate interests” the interests that are important to a business or organisation are not enough. These conditions must include Consent of the data subject Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject or to take steps to enter into a contract Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of a data subject or another person Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller Necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests, rights or freedoms of the data subject. Note that this condition is not available to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. Biometric data It defines biometric data as special categories of personal data and prohibits its processing, thereby protecting people from having their information shared with third parties without their consent. Biometric data are: _“personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allows or confirms the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data”. _ Conditions for processing special categories of data Processing of special categories of data for the purpose of \"uniquely identifying a natural person\" is prohibited, but it contains some exceptions. Explicit consent of the data subject, unless reliance on consent is prohibited by EU or Member State law Processing is necessary for carrying out obligations under employment, social security or social protection law, or a collective agreement Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of a data subject or another individual where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent Processing carried out by a not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim provided the processing relates only to members or former members (or those who have regular contact with it in connection with those purposes) and provided there is no disclosure to a third party without consent Processing relates to personal data manifestly made public by the data subject Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or where courts are acting in their judicial capacity Processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of Union or Member State law which is proportionate to the aim pursued and which contains appropriate safeguards Processing is necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine, for assessing the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or a contract with a health professional Processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of healthcare and of medicinal products or medical devices Processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, or scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes The right to be forgotten The Regulation states that consent must be explicit before the collection of the data. As in, users must be opted-out by default and be provided with an opt-in, instead of default be opted-in (often without their knowledge) and then have to search for an opt-out. Also, “the data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time”.​ Data breaches must be notified within 72 hours If a company or organisation discovers a data breach, then processors must inform the authorities within 72 hours of discovery. Companies managing biometric information can be hit with penalties if they do not make efforts to secure that data. Big penalties. Data protection by design and by default The Article 25 Data Protection by Design (DPbD) seeks to embed privacy protection at every level from conception to deployment. DPbD is not only about technological design. It extends to IT systems, accountable business practices, and physical design and networked infrastructure. This integrated approach is “an important factor in avoiding falling into techno-centric solutions to a sociotechnical problem.” In usual engineering practice, legal issues are considered obstacles to be overcome after a novel IT solution has been built and is to be rolled out. DPbD uses a reversed approach, whereby systems and processes are conceived and developed with privacy protection at their core. Legitimate interest Under the old directive that aimed to regulate data correlation, not just data collection, it was illegal to process personal data without a “legitimate interest”, and that legal basis was unavailable to data brokers (Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests of the data controller under Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC). Now, Recital 47 - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - Overriding legitimate interest* states: ”[t]he processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest“ . Can the data industry rely on legitimate interests or is it required to obtain consent despite the absence of a relationship with the data subjects? Under the GDPR, the legal basis for...",

    "c": "Panopticon by Ty Myrddin Published on April 22, 2021 Social theorist Jeremy Bentham’s original projection for a panoptic prison, made it so a prisoner never knew if he was being watched. A circular prison with a single guard tower in the middle was the original blueprint for the structure. It seems we have created some heterarchical form of panopticon on the internet, where just about everybody is spying on everybody else from behind sunglasses and masks. In particular big data corporations and nation states seem very busy with that, in very organised and automated ways. Hack-all-around-you, surveillance, and de-anonymisation seem to have become common practice (and competition). Machine learning (ML) is a key component in technologies such as predictive analytics and artificial intelligence. The Computer seems to be running the show. Most of the current AI offerings on the market can identify associations in large quantities of data, but can not work out complex phenomena of cause and effect or identify modifiable factors that can engender desired outcomes. Yet. I don’t know what is more dangerous, a world run by Black Rock ’s Aladdin -like machines as if they can, or development of machines that actually can and then making ourselves dependent on these even more. ML is used to review large volumes of data and identify patterns and trends. An error, for example a faulty sensor generating a flawed data set, can cause rippling effects within a machine learning interface, because events after the error may be flawed, skewed or just plain undesirable. Errors do occur, and it is a susceptibility that developers have thus far been unable to premeditate and negate consistently. Imagine, if people were to rely on these patterns and trends?!?

    "c": "Pave the way for distributed clouds on premises by Ty Myrddin Published on November 07, 2024 Steampunk airship fleet by Greg Hildebrandt, Vladimir Kush, Gediminas Pranckevicius, Erik Johansson, and Peter Mohrbacher Current trends Virtualisation solutions and moving data, computational, and software capabilities to the cloud drives for example, cloud-native and serverless applications. Its adoption signifies that centralisation of software and hardware resources in the hyperscale data centres allows for energy aware storage solutions like using Solid-State Drives for data needing high transfer speeds and long-term backup storage solutions for the rest of the data . Data centres can also use solar and wind farms , which is less likely an option for smaller organisations. Detection and shutdown of idle servers can also easily be done centrally to save energy. Most of all, the cloud enables use on demand of resources and geolocation for bringing a service near its end-points now. Development of Integrated infrastructures concerns dedicated sustainable hardware for software development, and includes domain specific hardware. Near future Edge computing is a distributed model that brings some computational tasks and data storage closer to the user (as source of data and as consumer). It can range from static mini-clouds on premises to flexible follow-the-need services via onboard computing and distributed networks of computational nodes. Originally developed with IoT applications in mind, mini-clouds on premises can be perceived as an intermediate step towards a completely distributed paradigm following and supporting the ongoing trend in decentralised energy production and smart energy grids. This then can allow for better profiling of energy consumption patterns and data usage patterns. AI computational tasks are very energy greedy. Trends such as federated learning algorithms, data compression of curated data, and approximate computing help reduce energy consumption, and perhaps there will be data-centric green AI techniques . Especially worth mentioning is sustainability-aware self-adaptation , using decision maps. What all three need is further research, academic and industrial eduction, additional learning paths, and most of all, an attitude towards responsibility for sustainable solutions created by design. Designs will likely first focus on reuse and hardware lifecycle management for creating longer lasting and better maintainable hardware, at a trade-off for being able to adopt new types of hardware when they become available. The far future? High power usage in computing caused by the von Neumann bottleneck is a significant sustainability issue, and Non-von Neumann architectures promise solutions for sustainable and energy-efficient nodes, especially at the edge layer. Photonic integrated circuits have already enabled fast artificial neural networks. Photonics can perhaps piggy-back on distributed paradigms. Problems Awareness creation requires monitoring and communicating environmental impacts and a behavioural change in data consumption patterns, and is a big problem because there is not enough digital spine (yet) . Real progress requires shared responsibility and accountability by all involved in all value chains. A very big ask. Unclear use, business, and communal cases and little activating legislation like dynamic pricing on real-time energy demands, make such changes very hard. Especially unclear are the effects on provision quality, energy savings, and the developments in the evolution of technology ecosystems, for example for federated mini-clouds on premises. A spine could help. These issues are complex and are thought to need to be solved on an international level first. This can take decades, if it happens at all. People don't like change. Really? People LOVE change, IF coming in the right proportion, at the right time and in the right way. If a proposed change is not being implemented, then the problem is with the change and not with people. Apparently there are not enough champions that have the decision power and budget to take the initiative and steer towards sustainability. There seems to be a perceived need for a coordinated change, sharing costs/risks and preventing compartmentalisation and silos. When using a large cloud provider, users give their power to make sustainability changes away to the provider. One just has to follow. In the context of federated mini-clouds, we can perhaps find sufficient champions in sustainability NGO's. What if ... What if, instead of going (only) top-down, we could also go bottom up in some small organisations, preferably with off-the-shelf open source Cloud solutions such as OpenStack , and work towards an on-premises cloud, and find some other like-minded organisations to share resources with to create a small distributed cloud. Then we can make guides, and include some of the monitoring, provision quality, and energy savings results giving similar other organisations more choices for their decisions on how to progress towards more sustainable set-ups. What if we can pave ways? Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for that very purpose.

    "c": "Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by Ty Myrddin Published on September 08, 2019 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights consists of 30 articles affirming an individual’s rights which, although not legally binding in themselves, have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties, economic transfers, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions, and other laws. The Declaration was the first step in the process of formulating the International Bill of Human Rights, which was completed in 1966, and came into force in 1976, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified them. Some legal scholars have argued that because countries have constantly invoked the Declaration for more than 50 years, it has become binding as a part of customary international law. Courts of several countries have concluded that the Declaration is not in and of itself part of domestic law. Article 12 No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. Article 25 Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection. Article 26 Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit. Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.

    "c": "Information war technology by Ty Myrddin Published on September 27, 2019 States are increasingly launching non-lethal attacks against an enemy’s information systems and people – this is the rise of information warfare. Not only is it a geopolitical “game”, states are also attacking their own people for maintaining dominance, corporations do to get you to buy their stuff, political groups are attacking other political groups for believing in something else, and individuals take out their frustration on others. Information warfare may involve collection of tactical information, assurance(s) that one’s own information is valid, spreading of propaganda or disinformation to demoralize or manipulate the enemy and the public, undermining the quality of opposing force information and denial of information-collection opportunities to opposing forces. Information warfare is closely linked to psychological warfare. In the big, and often also, in the small. Therefor researching the patterns of psychological warfare is easy. One can simply observe them in oneself and in ones own circles. For example, the myth of technological sufficiency that many depending on the system seem to believe in, identifies technology as the critical factor to solve any issue. Yet more technology is not likely to end any large scale (political) warfare. The new black bag is digital Over the past decade specially-trained CIA clandestine operators have mounted over one hundred extremely sensitive black bag jobs designed to penetrate foreign government and military communications and computer systems, as well as the computer systems of some of the world’s largest foreign multinational corporations. Spyware software has been secretly planted in computer servers; secure telephone lines have been bugged; fiber optic cables, data switching centres and telephone exchanges have been tapped; and computer backup tapes and disks have been stolen or surreptitiously copied in these operations. In other words, the CIA has become instrumental in setting up the shadowy surveillance dragnet that has now been thrown into public view. Sources within the U.S. intelligence community confirm that since 9/11, CIA clandestine operations have given the NSA access to a number of new and critically important targets around the world, especially in China and elsewhere in East Asia, as well as the Middle East, the Near East, and South Asia. ~ The CIA’s New Black Bag Is Digital, 2013 And it is not just the CIA, it resembles a panopticon in which all previously colonising countries are involved, to secure their continuity, intake of oil and rare earth elements, enhanced power and authority, status pursuit of ideological goals and objectives and general growth of their agency, marginalising entire populations of nation states with the assistance of local elites in the process. “Generations” of weapons “All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe that we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.” ~ Sixth generation warfare: manipulating space and time EMP weapons (electro-magnetic-pulse), HEMP (high altitude EMP), E-bombs (electromagnetic bombs), magnetic flux compression generator/microwave and/or radio-frequency radiation. 7GW? “Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the director of the opponent’s fate.” ~ Sun Tzu Information warfare is a concept involving the battlespace use and management of information and communication technology in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent. Information warfare is the manipulation of information trusted by a target without the target’s awareness so that the target will make decisions against their interest but in the interest of the one conducting information warfare. As a result, it is not clear when information warfare begins, ends, and how strong or destructive it is. Information warfare may involve the collection of tactical information, assurance(s) that one’s own information is valid, spreading of propaganda or disinformation to demoralize or manipulate the enemy and the public, undermining the quality of the opposing force’s information and denial of information-collection opportunities to opposing forces.

    "c": "Capturing credentials by Ty Myrddin Published on February 24, 2023 Image credit: Xkcd Some of the most common techniques adversaries use to capture credentials include finding or guessing credentials, and passing or relaying password hashes. Finding credentials Password storage targets on Windows after a compromise include operating system memory, user files such as Excel spreadsheets, and email inboxes and sent boxes, various system files like powershell history, the registry, and sticky notes. Attackers might try harvesting credentials stored in webserver configuration files and application files, operating system memory, a web browsers' autocomplete history or password manager, hard-coded in applications, and in cloud applications . The two most common ways for an adversary to intercept passwords is via an on-path attack , also known as Man in the Middle (MitM) attack, and via exploiting promiscuous protocols, such as LLMNR and NetBIOS, IPv6, and MDNS. An example of the first is poisoning Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables in a network switching device, getting it to forward traffic to an unauthorised port before being forwarded to its intended destination, waiting for a password hash, then pulling the hash offline for cracking it. Promiscuous protocols that can be tricked into sending a password hash to an unvetted recipient can result in a breach if the password is not long enough and is not difficult to guess . Guessing credentials Insecure web applications in general can be abused to bypass application access control lists (ACLs) or forge valid tokens. Adversaries confronted with a secure web application which does not leak platform, patch or configuration information; with code that protects against injection and scripting attacks; and with strong account access and lockout controls, may still try password guessing. Password lockout policies can sometimes be bypassed with password spraying . Passing or relaying password hashes The Windows NTLM algorithm algorithm is susceptible to the well-known pass-the-hash attack. Newer Windows authentication algorithms such as Net-NTLM hashes make use of a one-time challenge. But if message signing is not both enabled and required by every host in the domain, these challenges can be relayed by attackers. Relaying attacks can be done via cross-protocol relays that use any other protocol that supports Windows Net-NTLM authentication. Even Kerberos authentication , though more secure, can be successfully attacked. In some cases, Kerberos can be abused to impersonate other users within the environment and forge a valid ticket. And social engineering is still one of the most effective ways adversaries can use. Phishing seems to be the most popular choice. These attacks use persuasion techniques such as impersonating technical support personnel, name-dropping a person of authority, communicating a sense of urgency, and using plenty of technical jargon and alphabet soup to confuse users and elicit compliance. \"For verification purposes, please give us the code we just sent to you.\" Bypassing MFA The easiest way to bypass MFA is to social engineer. Another way could be to look for configurations that allow authentication that bypasses MFA, like application programming interfaces (APIs) or clients who do not require MFA, such as Exchange Web Services and Exchange Modern Authentication, which can provide a non-2FA-protected backdoor login. MFA-protected user accounts may not yet have been set up. For the adversary, time to do so. This is not quiet though, as the original user gets locked out of their account and will sound the alarm. A common bypass technique is to use the hashed Windows NTLM password hash to access functionality not protected by MFA. And last but not least, MFA systems need a fallback plan, and any weaknesses in a fail-open plan can be exploited. Adding biometrics? Adding fingerprint on top? FaceID? What if you are sleeping and someone uses your biometrics to unlock the device? What if someone knocks you out? Impact People, and companies and nations of all sizes have to defend against multiple threat events like ransomware, attacks going after personally identifiable information (PII) and the associated identity theft and possible further compromise, and scenarios in nation-state-sponsored global cyberwarfare, including boots-on-the-ground warfare contexts that involve digital communications.

    "c": "Grey areas by Ty Myrddin Published on May 07, 2021 The creation of legal grey areas, per three examples, using the example of sexual consent for clarity and because that is where the “consent” concept originated and is expanding from in everyday life for digital consent. Sexual consent I don’t think “sexual consent” exists other than as a legal term. If I “consent”, it means “I voluntarily agree to engage in a certain sexual activity”. Further, let’s assume I had both the freedom and capacity to consent, then the question is whether I agree to the activity by choice, not by coercion or force. A grey area. If the other person “did not reasonably believe” that I consented and continued to engage in sexual behaviour despite me saying “no”, he or she committed a sexual offence. This makes rape victims the key element in the issues surrounding consent and where common notions of victim-blaming often come into play: “The clothing she wore was an invitation”, “She was drunk”, “We live together”, and “We’ve had sex before”, etc. As far as I know, wearing clothes, having a drink, living together with someone, or having mutually consenting sex, are not criminal activities. Ofcourse there are those who want pleasurable and mutual consensual sexuality to move away from the old “no means no” mindset towards the concept of “affirmative consent”: “yes means yes” because it promises more “pushing of will”. Affirmative consent is not just about getting permission, but about making sex based on mutual desire and enthusiasm. A wonderful ideal to strive for. But re-inventing the wheel by using “yes means yes” instead of “no means no” does not remove the grey area. With ‘yes means yes’ we imply that every person has the power to say what they truly want when it comes to consent. This ignores the reality that people say ‘yes’ sometimes out of fear, and sometimes as a result of coercion . How about no forcing of will or coercion to push will on others, period. General Data Protection Regulation Digital consent follows similar patterns. The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is, in summary, a series of protocols that creates rules for businesses in Europe on how to process and maintain data collected from European residents. At first glance, the GDPR champions the rights of and consent of everyday internet users and targets a supposed grey-area black hat tactics that have exploited unsuspecting people browsing the internet. But it wasn’t a grey area, it was a black area, and by regulating the collection of data it actually legitimises the processing and maintenance of data from European residents and creates a grey area in which users can give consent or opt-in or opt-out, and have to apply to have their data removed and/or to be forgotten. Hours after the GDPR came into force users were confronted with consent-or-be-gone types of messages and large suits against Facebook and Google appeared, accusing them of “coercing” users into accepting their data collection policies. And as a “side note”, the legislation was purely for the private sector in order to “protect the public”. What about the public institutions funded by taxes from the people that are protected under the GDPR? What impact does the GDPR have on governing institutions? What do governments in Europe have to do because of the GDPR? Apparently nothing: “under EU law, the right to privacy and the right to protection of personal data are two distinct fundamental human rights.” The European Parliament distances itself from national authorities collecting and processing citizens private data by allocating all such activities to the nation alone, The Court of Justice of the EU does not have jurisdiction over cases that involve surveillance conducted by national authorities in order to safeguard the internal security of the EU Members. How about no collection of data, period. Federated Learning of Cohorts Third-party cookies are gradually going extinct now that many browsers block them, but that doesn’t mean Google (and similar others) will respect our privacy. Google started an experiment called FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts). It runs in Google’s Chrome browser and tracks a user’s online behaviour. Supposedly FLoC will allow personalized ads without the collection of data that can be tied to specific people. By assigning each browser an anonymised ID and then adding that ID into a large group, a cohort, where only the overall patterns are accessible to advertisers, the idea is that our privacy will remain intact, while Google and its advertising partners use it for widespread tracking and personalisation of ads. Marshall Vale, the product manager of Google’s privacy sandbox: “Before a cohort becomes eligible, Chrome analyzes it to see if the cohort is visiting pages with sensitive topics, such as medical websites or websites with political or religious content, at a high rate. If so, Chrome ensures that the cohort isn’t used, without learning which sensitive topics users were interested in.” Sounds awesome, but what is really happening and possible in this grey area? A user’s browser, a tool to interact with the internet, is supposed to be sacred. FLoC turns it into a real-time tracking tool collecting the most sensitive information about an individual user’s browsing habits without the user being able to circumvent or opt out of this data collection. And when the FLoC data set is big enough, deanonymisation will become easy . For example, cohorts of users sharing the same location data, shopping in the same neighbourhood, being active in the same time zone, can easily be grouped together by demographics, and if the data is combined with other tracking mechanisms such as social media analytics or data sets purchased from data brokers , fingerprinting users based on age, class, ethnicity, political parties becomes trivial. Google announced that in Chrome version 89 they will forcibly enable and trial their FLoC data-collection initiative without the consent of users or webmasters. Our options are reduced to “You either have old tracking or new tracking”, but you are going to get it anyway? Not entirely, because users and webserver adminstrators and webmasters can jump through hoops, again. It is annoying, very annoying, these constant attacks on our privacy. How about no tracking, period. And as a “side note”: Wouldn’t it be good if algorithms that keep users engaged for maximising revenues by recommending (political, sensasionalist, hateful, false) content, simply did not exist?

    "c": "Defendable internet? by Ty Myrddin Published on February 2, 2023 David Clark can remember exactly when he was confronted with the Internet's dark side. Presiding over a meeting of network engineers, news broke that a dangerous computer worm was crawling through the wires. November 2, 1988, using the Internet's essential open nature, the first worm crashed 6000 machines, then one-tenth of the Internet. Those who developed this early network further, focused on the technical challenges of moving information quickly and reliably. They did not focus on how you could wreck this system intentionally, claiming online crime and aggression are the manifestation of basic human needs and wants, beyond easy technological solutions. Decades later, in 2023, the threats seem to be exploding. The targets for destruction have leapt from computers to banks, retailers, government agencies, critical mechanical systems in dams, power plants and aircraft, mobile apps and phones, clouds, our private data. Adversaries seem to be winning. Most likely because they have the luxury to focus only on the technical aspects of their work, while defenders have to navigate complex political and regulatory environments . If defenders did not have to deal with such issues, they could maybe focus on how to redesign the Internet to make it an open, transparent, and yet secure internet for all to enjoy. And with enough funding ofcourse. Thomas Dullien and Halvar Flake also explored why we are not building such a defendable internet : who is motivated by who to do what - and how these incentives fail to produce the security level we desire. Five years later, at Black Hat Europe 2022, the question returns, with an answer raising more questions: A defendable internet is possible, but only with industry makeover . A makeover which is unlikely to happen, as are all the other make-overs needed, for example for closing inequality gaps to bring a more just economical balance to the world, and a makeover for substantially reducing the effect we humans are having on the environment, other species, and next generations. I have some questions on this \"dark side\", by which I mean the \"ignored impacts on others and the future\": Are the minds of those that feel like they are \"the winners\" locked into \"winning\", pretty much like drug addicts get \"locked in\" on the next shot/drink? Does short term thinking rule the mind of those \"up top\"? Does the \"now\" command more attention than effects on the future? Is it a legacy replacement problem? We know *that* one. The continuous putting out fires leaves no time for replacement efforts (until it is all burned down and there is nothing left to replace but some ashes). Why is it difficult to look beyond the next news cycle/catastrophe/breach? If time can be sliced, is it only getting finer, with ever-shorter periods shaping our (digital) world?

    "c": "Exploding hand-helds by Ty Myrddin Published on Sept 25, 2024 Cartoon by Joe Heller: Exploding pagers So what happened The first round of blasts began in Lebanon's capital Beirut and several other areas of the country at about 15:30 local time on Tuesday 17 september 2024 involving pagers. Another round of blasts, now from walkie-talkies, happened on Wednesday the 18th, at around 17:00 local time. Some of the pagers used by Hezbollah are models that run on lithium-ion batteries , which can cause dangerous explosions. According to information obtained by LBCI , the pager server can have been compromised, leading to the installation of a script that caused an overload. This then could have resulted in the overheating of the lithium battery, which then exploded. But it is unlikely that a regular pager battery alone can produce blasts that can injure multiple people (as was seen in some of the recorded attacks). It seems more likely the pagers were interdicted and modified with explosives. Interdiction Using so-called \"interdiction\", the target hardware is intercepted while on route to a next supplier in the supply chain. The hardware must be unpackaged, modified, repackaged and put back in the chain without raising red flags. Using \"Seeding\" is probably even harder, because the manipulation happens on the factory floor. Access in both cases can be gained by social engineering, like posing as officials, bribery, threatening an insider, etcetera. Hardware supply chain attacks are extremely hard to defend from . Once the hardware is successfully modified, adversaries can use the back door to gain further access or exfiltrate data, it is difficult to detect and fix, and gives long-term access. It is entirely possible that explosives planted in the pagers were detonated using a remote command, perhaps hidden in a pager message. But erm? there is not much space in the devices. Which explosives were that then? Targeting costs To make it a targeted attack the attacker would need an operative to make sure the modified devices are delivered to the targets and not just anyone. This requires a mole, or a bribe. And time. How long does it take to infiltrate Hezbollah providers to the point of delivering hundreds of devices? Why this attack? Buying time? Replacing a large number of pagers will take time. Deterrence? The first round came just hours after Israel's security cabinet made the safe return of residents to the north of the country an official war goal. Showing the depth of Israel's intelligence pockets might deter Hezbollah. Amos Yadlin , a former head of Israeli military intelligence, said the Israeli attack displayed \"very impressive penetration capabilities, technology and intelligence.\" The deterrence factor however, does not seem to be working. Did anyone else notice the use of the word \"penetration\"? What on Earth do they think they are doing? And it is not a surprise either. Similar capabilities were already shown. Still, the scale of this attack seems \"unprecedented\". As mp wrote: \"In other words, it seems to me, this action is only really possible (\"easy\") if you are already deeply invested in the dark arts of arms trafficking and dealing, which is to say: embedded in the global, criminal economy. It is statecraft.\" Western response There are UN accusations that this constitutes a war crime, as well as congratulations on the ingenuity of the attack, while it injured at least 2800 people and killed at least nine. But not really an outcry. I have not seen a real outcry on what is happening in Gaza either, by the way. Have we gone numb because of all the war and killing ? The best explanation I have seen is from Patrice: \"In general, I think there is by now a weariness to address the increasingly dystopian aspect of tech, wether it's corporate or military developed and deployed, since (i) it makes one very depressive (ii) it won't help anyway\" Historically, technological advances are double-edged swords. Technology has been used against us, while claimed to have been designed to help us. Such opportunism rules mankind. What if our governments are taken over by less-democratic forces? If hand-held devices, such as walkie-talkies or pagers, can be implanted with explosives and can kill targets, how safe are any of us from this mode of attack? Posting this is also unlikely to help, but I feel slightly better. Raw magic crackled from their spines, earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for that very purpose.

Now it finally moved on. Python warnings In Python, backslashes are used to introduce special character sequences known as escape sequences. For example, the escape sequence ' ' can represent a newline character, and '\\t' a tab. But if a backslash is followed by an invalid character, it raises a warning. In general, a warning does not halt program execution, but it is essential to address these warnings, as they can indicate potential issues with the code. Ignoring these warnings can lead to unintended consequences, such as incorrect string formatting, unexpected behaviour, or even security vulnerabilities.

    "c": "Governmental ghost stories by Ty Myrddin Published on February 17, 2020 This old-fashioned horror anthology isn’t terrifying or scream-inducing; instead, it’s closer in spirit to the moody, clammy, atmospheric English movies of decades past, and parodies thereof. I am again reminded of Dr. Strangelove. The UK Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) Beginning of 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK’s Snooper’s Charter is unlawful . In 2018, Australia’s parliament passed legislation that allows intelligence and law enforcement agencies to demand access to encrypted communications data. And the GCHQ now wantsss that preciousss information too. Secure messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and iMessage can be forced to create backdoors or to operate a “ghost protocol” that “CC’s” an encrypted message to a third-party when it is sent. A state run Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)?!? The ghastly ghostly proposal from GCHQ was made late 2018 by its director Ian Levy, and involved “silently adding a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call”, according to the “Principles for a More Informed Exceptional Access Debate” article written by Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson. The Letter Then a coalition of 47 organisations and individuals wrote to the GCHQ, raising objections to the proposal to insert privileged users in encrypted conversations, in order for the government to spy on such interactions without actually breaking encryption. The GCHQ “ghost protocol” would seriously undermine user security and trust. O Really?!? And while I do think it is an excellent idea to bring it to the table, among the signets are also Apple and Facebook’s WhatsUp. Ironically, Facebook is the biggest and worst example of how business models arrogate and appropriate data about us, read all our emails, comments, and other things we put online and behind the scenes with friends, family, business connections, in order that this content might be tied into our profiles and make us easier targets for their paying customers – the advertisers and marketers of big and small organisations – to drill down into our inner desires and close that all important sale. And Apple continues to give the impression it thinks privacy is worth fighting for, even if only as a business Unique Selling Point. The intrusive activities and long-term business models of “data science” are Silicon Valley’s very own(ed) ghost protocol.

It is a forum of countries describing themselves as committed to democracy and the market economy, providing a platform to compare policy experiences, seeking answers to common problems, identify good practices and coordinate domestic and international policies of its members. It’s recommendations for protection of personal data are: Notice — data subjects should be given notice when their data is being collected; Purpose — data should only be used for the purpose stated and not for any other purposes; Consent — data should not be disclosed without the data subject’s consent; Security — collected data should be kept secure from any potential abuses; Disclosure — data subjects should be informed as to who is collecting their data; Access — data subjects should be allowed to access their data and make corrections to any inaccurate data Accountability — data subjects should have a method available to them to hold data collectors accountable for not following the above principles. The EC General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has incorporated all seven principles. The United States, while endorsing the recommendations, is not implementing them.

    "c": "Five Eyes alliance by Ty Myrddin Published on August 28, 2018 The UKUSA agreement, first called the BRUSA Agreement, was signed in March 1946 for cooperation in signals intelligence between the UK and the USA. It was extended to include Canada in 1948 and Australia and New Zealand in 1956. It was a secret agreement until 1999 when it was disclosed by the Australian Defence Signals Directorate. Nowadays, it’s called the Five Eyes (FVEY). On June 25, 2010, the agreement was (partially) disclosed by Britain and the United States . The UK link requires payment. This repository is a complete collection of all documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden that have subsequently been published by news media around the world. Created to share signals intelligence between allies, the agreement was intended to streamline the collection and analysis of intercepted data and communications. There is thought to be around 130 known listening stations worldwide. Some are huge, such as Britain’s Menwith Hill complex, and some are small or even “internet of things”-size small and function automatically. The agreement standardises terminology, codes, clearances, handling procedures and access to facilities. An exchange of personnel appears common. Governments of the UKUSA members have been careful to seem to restrain their agencies from spying on their own citizens in politician and watchdog words and very clear laws, but nothing keeps the other members of the agreement from spying on their partners’ citizens and handing over that information as part of the intelligence sharing agreement. Not only that, apparently intelligence agencies are above such laws, and the laws are updated, upgraded and adapted to the actual capacities of intelligence agencies, not the other way around.

    "c": "It is not enough! by Ty Myrddin Published on April 21, 2021 The GDPR and ICCPR are not enough, and that is not only because of the tremendous struggle to implement their rules. The GDPR for example, actually legitimises the entire information industry by making it a grey area . It came into force May 25 at midnight 2018 and is supposed to give users a free choice, whether they agree to data usage or not. The opposite feeling spread on the screens of many users: tons of “consent boxes” popped up online or in applications, often combined with a threat that the service can no longer be used if users do not consent. On the first day of GDPR noyb.eu filed four complaints against Google (Android), Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram over “forced consent”. Politics no longer seems to be able to cope with six of the greatest challenges of our time: destruction of the environment, digitalisation, the power of algorithms, systematic lies in politics, unchecked globalisation and threats to the rule of law. We all want to live in an environment that is healthy and protected. We want to use the internet in a way determined by us, without being scrutinised and manipulated, we want to be able to trust intelligent machines and not be threatened by them. We have seen that the prerequisite of our democracy is truth and not lies, and we want to end the exploitation of people in a globalised world. The old constitutions of Europe have no clear answers for the enormous upheavals of recent years. ~ Sign for demanding Six New Fundamental Rights We Demand Six New Fundamental Rights A constitutional convention should expand the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to include the following fundamental rights: Article 1 - Environment Everyone has the right to live in an environment that is healthy and protected.

    "c": "Internet (in)security trends by Ty Myrddin Published on April 22, 2021 “Gotta feel kind of bad for nation-state hackers who spend years implanting and cultivating some hardware exploit, only to discover the entire target database is already exposed to anyone with a web browser.” Most E2EE are secure against only the weakest passive adversaries, breakable not by cryptanalysis of underlying cryptographic algorithms but by flawed system designs and security assumptions. Unencrypted metadata and access patterns make these systems susceptible to inference attacks. And recently made laws seem to have been made to prepare the way for agencies to legitimately gather encrypted data via backdoors and ghost protocols. The MitM server-to-server HTTPS communication attack for example, is not about a vulnerability, it is about a flawed concept. The abstraction of trusted Internet routing is wrong. DNSsec and IPsec routing were developed as stopgaps, but make packet flow harder to troubleshoot and add excessive administrative overhead. Hackers increasingly use search engine poisoning attacks because they are so easy to do, and several automated tool-kits are readily available to make it even easier. Credential stuffing is currently one of the most common techniques used to take-over user accounts. Credential spilling is when credentials gained from data breaches are sold to other adversaries. Credential stuffing is the large scale use of automated means to test stolen passwords against other unrelated websites. This is a possible and often successful attack because of the tendency for users to recycle their passwords for multiple accounts. Polymorphic malware created by machines are likely to develop (further). These learn to evade detection based on automated vulnerability detection and complex data analysis. DDoS and DrDoS attacks employ swarms of these vulnerable endpoints to attack public infrastructure through massively coordinated communication channels. Smarter control software exists but is costly, and certainly not available to consumer-grade endpoints. Think unpredictable spikes in infrastructure use and availability issues. Meanwhile, such poorly-protected vulnerable endpoints are ubiquitous and provide starting points for further structured attacks. And there is more to come. Mobile devices and connected sensors such as smart home devices, biochip transponders on farm animals and electric clams in coastal waters, you name it, the monitoring craze is everywhere, increasing the attack surface.

    "c": "Ubuntu 22.04 and apt-key deprecation by Ty Myrddin Published on May 12, 2022 After upgrading to Ubuntu 22.04 from 20.04 several repositories are disabled, and deprecation warnings on its signing keys are given. The apt-key deprecation message reads, \" Warning: apt-key is deprecated. Manage keyring files in trusted.gpg.d instead (see apt-key(8)) \", and \" Key is stored in legacy trusted.gpg keyring (/etc/apt/trusted.gpg), see the DEPRECATION section in apt-key(8) for details. \" Long story short, installing a key in the global keyring the way we used to mean that any packages signed by that key are trusted. The new [signed-by] option limits the damage when a repository's keys are compromised; the key cannot be used to forge packages unrelated to the repository itself and limits the damage done. New repositories need to be signed in a different way, and existing keys need to be exported to /usr/share/keyrings and the associated source.list files adapted to reflect that change. Below is a summarized version of applying the excellent instructions given by Debian and apt-key Is Deprecated. How To Add OpenPGP Repository Signing Keys Without It On Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Etc. for our setup in Ubuntu 22.04. Note that curl can be used instead of wget , and that key extensions can also be .pgp , .asc , .key , .whatever , as long as it is a key in a format apt supports. If a key is not ascii-armored, gpg will exit successfully without changing anything. If apt chokes on the resulting key, it is likely because the key is in another format like the newer binary \"keybox database\" format, which apt does not support. Adding keys the new way Checking whether a key is armored: $ wget https://example.com/key/repo-key.gpg $ file repo-key.gpg If the answer is repo-key.gpg: PGP public key block Public-Key (old) , then it is an armored key, but there is no harm in piping through --dearmor by default. Armored keys: $ wget -O- <https://example.com/key/repo-key.gpg> | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/<myrepository>-archive-keyring.gpg Non-armored keys: $ wget -O- <https://example.com/key/repo-key.gpg> | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/<myrepository-archive-keyring.gpg> Getting keys from a keyserver: $ sudo gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/<myrepository>-archive-keyring.gpg --keyserver <hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80> --recv-keys <fingerprint> All keys will be stored in the /usr/share/keyrings/ folder to be used in adding the repository with the signed-by option in a sources.list file.

The below method also works for re-enabling repositories that use install scripts and do not have their signing keys listed on their sites, like for nordvpn and slack . Moving keys from /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d First move all existing keyring files in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ to the (newly created) /usr/local/share/keyrings/ directory as-is . /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d$ sudo mv repo-key.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/ Then, using an editor of choice, update all the corresponding .list files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d to have the [signed-by] field referencing its own key (as described above), and remove the hash that disabled the repository.

These are boundaries not of power but of duty, for a witch is generally the midwife, doctor, life adviser, and moral policeman of a village. Your average witch is not, by nature, a social animal as far as other witches are concerned. There's a conflict of dominant personalities. There's a group of ringleaders without a ring. There's a basic unwritten rule of witchcraft which is 'Don't do what you will, do what I say'. The natural size of a coven is one. Witches only get together when they can't avoid it. Witches' Magic Works with your device Headology works like psychology, but many witches think \"psychology\" is a bad word, or that it means \"having a psychological problem\". The practice of headology relies on the principle that what people believe is what is real (for that person). Transportation The broomstick is the device for magically enhanced travel favoured by witches. While associated with witches, wizards have been known to use them in extremis. Up to Date The edge between life and death, light and dark, good and evil, today and tomorrow, this world and the next... and many others. An \"edge witch\" watches over and guards these edges. Edge witches learn to think fast, because edges can shift so quickly. It also hones senses that most people never know they have. With Love Consider a witch's cottage as the permanent free hospital in a village, where the word \"free\" is used loosely in this context.

    "c": "CommonJS to ESM by Ty Myrddin Updated on January 3, 2022 The react-base app was originally bootstrapped with Create React App using --template typescript . The available npm start , npm test and npm run build scripts work fine. But adding an index.js with a mix of commonJS and ES modules and doing an import of .json files, is a problem. Apparently modules are in transition but not all are ESM yet. We will hold our experimentations with such index.js files trying to use node-fetch and ngrok for now. We may come back to this later again. For now, we just used the Nginx on the droplet. Troubles Having added an index.js to the react-base project (node v16.13.1) for trying out ngrok : import env from './src/env/.env.json'; const handler = require(\"serve-handler\"); const http = require(\"http\"); const ngrok = require(\"ngrok\"); const fetch = require(\"node-fetch\"); ... running node index.js throws an error and trying to solve that we could be going around in circles. ES modules The implementation is now stable and can be used with the earlier commonJS module system. (Statement valid for version 13.14.0 and above). This means that files ending with .mjs or .js extensions (with the nearest package.json file with a field type) are treated as ES modules. First run $ node index.js (node:686975) Warning: To load an ES module, set \"type\": \"module\" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension. [snip] SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module Adding \"type: module\" to the package.json file enables ES6 modules. In ES6, the source code should use import syntax. Previous ES use require syntax. Sticking to ES5 We changed the import in the index.js to a require and it worked, but a lot of other files now give the same error. With type:module In the to the index.js nearest parent package.json file, we added a top-level \"type\" field with a value of \"module\": // package.json { [snip] \"type\": \"module\" [snip] } Problem solved, BUT, this gives another error message: TypeError [ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION]: Unknown file extension \".json\" for /react-base/src/env/.env.json Apparently, JSON module import is experimental ? It is supported only in commonJS mode, not in modules. Supposedly adding the flag —experimental-json-modules with node fixes this error and make commonJS and module mode works with .json file import. $ node --experimental-json-modules index.js Results in this error: file:///react-base/index.js:3 const handler = require(\"serve-handler\"); ^ ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and '/react-base/package.json' contains \"type\": \"module\". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension. Renaming index.js to index.cjs and $ node --experimental-json-modules index.cjs results in: SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module And we are back at the beginning. Rewriting imports The index.js tries to use both import and require module patterns, which isn’t possible. We either have to rewrite the \"require\" statements in index.js to \"imports\", like: import pkg from 'serve-handler'; const { handler } = pkg; But serve-handler , http , and ngrok are all commonJS modules, and doing this can lead to unexpected effects. We tried, just for the heck of it. So we undo the \"type\": \"module\", in package.json and rewrite the import env from './src/env/.env.json'; to a commonJS require: const env = require('./src/env/.env.json'); : $ node index.js /react-base/index.js:5 const fetch = require(\"node-fetch\"); ^ Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /react-base/node_modules/node-fetch/src/index.js from /react-base/index.js not supported. Instead change the require of /react-base/node_modules/node-fetch/src/index.js in /react-base/index.js to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules. node-fetch And the next problem appears: node-fetch was converted to be an ESM only package in version 3.0.0-beta.10 . It is now an ESM-only module and can not be imported with require. the async import() function from CommonJS to load node-fetch asynchronously: const fetch = (...args) => import('node-fetch').then(({default: fetch}) => fetch(...args)); Or downgrade to node-fetch version 2.6.6, which is built with CommonJS. <= For now WHERE'S MY COW?!

Teaching The Montessori philosophy offers a holistic approach to education that recognizes the innate potential and dignity of every individual. The autonomy, self-directed learning, and respect for the individual are principles which have far-reaching implications beyond traditional educational settings. Experiential Learning Theory, is a widely recognized and influential framework that describes how people learn through experience. People can use hands-on learning processes for all forms of learning. Digital defence @home This project is about understanding the landscape and securing @home (and @smallorganisational) contexts as good as we can ourselves. The approach is to pick the raisins out of the commercial porridge. What makes sense in our respective contexts? IPA Project A project, together with Meltem Arikan, sponsored by /ut7 for supporting Intimate Partner Abuse survivors in various (digital) ways. Digital defence @home IPA Project Facilitation Facilitation is the craft of guiding a group or individual through a participatory process that makes it easier to achieve their goals. Systems thinking Systems thinking expands the range of choices available for solving a problem by broadening our thinking and helping us phrase problems in new and other ways. The principles of systems thinking can make us aware that there are no flawless solutions and that the choices we make will have an impact on other parts of the system. By anticipating the impact of trade-offs, we can minimize the impacts or even use them to our advantage. As a result, systems thinking allows us to make better informed and less damaging choices. Systems thinking, in particular causal loop diagrams can be used to tell compelling stories describing how a system works. Retrospectives Retrospectives are popular in the team-working world of the Lean and Agile community. The technique was inspired by the work of Virginia Satir. She developed a technique called the Daily Temperature Reading for keeping relationships healthy and happy. Reflecting on what has happened in the past (first the positive and then the negative) and then figuring out what to do in the future to improve. And with a bit of creativity it can be made fun and enjoyable to do. Looking forward Scenario planning originated in the U.S. military for making strategic decisions, to plan and prepare for various possible futures. Today, scenario planning is used by all kinds of organisations world-wide. Adding obliviousness and congruence awarenesses to scenario planning choreographies make it a more balanced experience and suitable for planning deductive and inductive paths to possible futures. Systems thinking example Satir Temperature Reading (pdf) Scenario logics example Software development Software Development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining computer programs and applications. C and C++ C and C++ are used for high performance and low-level control. It is suited for backend systems, computationally intensive processes, and applications that require precise memory control. Been there, done that in the stone age of computer science. At the moment not much to show, but for some snippets. Python Python is simple, versatile, and readable, and often used for web development, data analysis, and AI. It is perfect for frontend scripts, prototyping, data manipulation, and creating user-friendly APIs for C++-based backend systems. A lot of frameworks (25+) have been developed for Python, providing a structure for the code and a set of tools and features that streamline the development process. Examples are Flask and FastAPI. Python frameworks Flask is a lightweight micro-framework used to quickly build simple web applications. It includes support for Jinja templates (a way to reuse HTML code), request handling, and application signaling. Both FastAPI and Starlette are built on top of Uvicorn, which is an ASGI server, but they serve different purposes and offer distinct features that can impact performance. Starlette provides the foundational tools for building web applications. It is lightweight and optimized for speed, making it suitable for simple applications. FastAPI is built on top of Starlette, adding features like automatic data validation and serialization. AI Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undoubtedly revolutionizing numerous fields, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment. Its potential to enhance efficiency, solve complex problems, and drive innovation is enormous. So is its energy use. The rapid advancement and integration of AI into society also raises significant ethical, social, and technical concerns that warrant critical examination. Exploring the various AI techniques can support such research (see below threat modelling example). Reverse engineering Flask application on headless (Netlify) Typesense, Starlette Search engine (under construction) Various explorations in AI Security Threat modelling Threat modeling is the process of using hypothetical scenarios, system diagrams, and testing to help secure systems and data. Deanonymisation refers to the process of reversing the anonymisation of data, thereby revealing the identity of individuals who were previously anonymous. This practice has significant implications for privacy, security, and ethics, particularly in an era where vast amounts of data are collected, shared, and analyzed. Pentesting A vulnerability assessment focuses on scanning hosts for vulnerabilities as individual entities. Penetration tests might start by scanning for vulnerabilities just as a regular vulnerability assessment but pentesting gives more information on how an attacker can chain vulnerabilities to achieve specific goals. During pentesting, focus remains on identifying vulnerabilities and establishing measures to protect the network, but it also considers the network as a whole ecosystem and how an attacker could profit from interactions between its components. Red teaming Red teaming is a term borrowed from the military. In military exercises, the red team simulates attack techniques to test the reaction capabilities of a defending blue team against known adversary strategies. In cybersecurity, the red team emulates a real threat actor's Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for measuring how well the blue team responds and to test any security controls in place. Usually the blue team is made up of members of a security incident response team (SIRT) and/or security operations team (SOC) , but in a small organisation can consist of the systems administrator with interested parties. Red teaming does not replace penetration testing. It complements it by focusing on detection and response rather than prevention. Red teaming improves penetration testing by taking into account more attack...",

    "c": "Raising security awareness The usual suspects A lot of funds are spent on security equipment, firewalls, encryption, pentesting, red teaming, you name it. And if someone can walk out the door with files under their arm, or a manager signs off on a control which does not work, or if someone clicks on a link in a phishing email, the keys to the king or queendom may well be within reach of an adversary. Curiosities, biases, and susceptibilities, can all be potential gateways. The good news is, these very human traits can also be used to improve security. Confirmation bias can make people assume an attack is done by a specific threat actor. Confirming that looking at alternative scenarios, and actively challenging existing belief systems can work to improve security stances. Bandwagon bias leads to taking the road traveled by everyone else. How about jumping on the bandwagon of building more diverse teams, fostering critical thinking, and encouraging devil’s advocate perspectives? Hindsight bias can cause vulnerabilities to remain undiscovered, even with many eyes on the code. When such a vulnerability is found, we can apply hindsight bias to the hindsight bias, and learn about the dangers of this particular bias. People more and more gather information from reading articles the internet and sharing with colleagues, including on how hackers target cognitive biases. Anchoring bias can cause risks with low likelihood or low impact to be viewed as more likely to happen than they really are in a specific context. Drop the anchor in improving internal communication for determining raw risks and residual risks. Test driven efforts There is no way to measure the success of security awareness efforts unless the behaviours that need to change are (continuously) identified. Measuring raising security awareness success requires building an evaluation framework that uses communication, simulated events, event logging and monitoring, and assessments to test its effectiveness from multiple perspectives. And in organisational contexts, nothing will work if management does not create an environment in which people (can) trust leadership to be learning too. And then get going making security fun, growing security thinking, care and guts, while tracking progress from currently perceived state to the next desired state. Hands-on workshops Learning goes best when it is made fun, takes one day, is done off-site, and includes discussing experiences. Experiential learning is the process of learning through hands-on experience, building upon what one knows to expand that knowledge into action. It is one of the most beneficial types of learning because one gets out of an experience what one puts in, and allows people to better retain what is learned and can be used for raising awareness. That which was experienced can not be unexperienced. Simulations and roleplay After having done some experiential training, up next could be simulations set up for specific situations in specific contexts of the organisation. This can even go as far as colourful teaming where a red team and blue team play out imaginary attack and defense scenarios. Human-readable guides Just like in pentesting, reports and guides have to be adapted for specific audiences, without “talking down”. The term “human-readable” implies information that is meaningful for people and that can be comprehended quickly. I do try. The very best guides are produced by and for people (in an organisation), after an experience making them the domain experts, after a hands-on exercise, or after a simulation.

    "c": " No instant transportation Digital security is a fascinating field to work in; it is not the good guys vs bad guys, white hats vs gray hats vs black hats, or about computer science, math and teaching degrees (although I have them). Technical knowledge is important, but that is just logic. A love for puzzling, not being afraid of new experiences, a lifetime of learning, understanding what makes people tick, and supporting others , will give better results. Never Up To Date People's devices, their data, and people themselves can be at risk. We need to prevent, find, and fix these vulnerabilities, before an attacker takes advantage. I do not assume I know it all, nor that which was valid yesterday, will be valid today. I keep researching and learning, and can transfer the knowledge and skills I do keep and make sense in context, and bring positive attitudes to the table. With Love Working with threats and threat modelling requires a paranoia mindset. A higher paranoia level makes it harder for an attacker to go undetected. It all depends on the possible impact what level of paranoia is needed. This can be unhealthy for our minds. I use humour. Laughing brings oxygen to the brain, which reduces the effects of paranoia. On top of that, an oxygenated mind is more relaxed and has a much greater capacity for clear thinking.

    "c": " the  The  is the premiere school of wizardry in Ankh-Morpork, founded in the year 1282 AM (1 UC) by Alberto Malich the Wise. The official motto of the UU is \"Nunc Id Vides, Nunc Ne Vides\", loosely translated as \"Now you see it, now you don't\". The unofficial motto is \"η β π\", or \"Eta Beta Pi\" (Eat A Better Pie). Its buildings are of ancient stone, and contain many dark, winding corridors and small rooms, far more than the size of the grounds should allow. UU Wizards study magic for many years the hard way. Reading an uncountable number of books, passing hard tests, getting one (or several) of the many degrees available and practicing all day long makes a great wizard. Few faculty members like to teach. They have virtual lectures in a classroom, (Room 3b) that does not exist, a happy arrangement mutually understood and respected by Faculty and students alike. On Wizardry Works with your device Wizards like to use instruments specially made for the purposes of practicing magic. The wizard's staff is a familiar and intuitive example; it stores magic that a wizard can use all at once. Transportation The broomstick is the device for magically enhanced travel favoured by witches . While associated with witches, wizards have been known to use them in extremis. Up to Date For surveilling all possible times and spaces of the multiverse, wizards have now advanced to the omniscope which is, sadly, very expensive monetarily to produce and very expensive magically to operate. With Love Wizards usually vie for the top position, the Archchancellor. Being invited in one of the orders, each wizard fights for the higher positions in the order, and fights off other wizards and other orders. Degrees The usual baccalaureates are Bachelor of Thaumatology (B.Thau), Bachelor of Magic (B.Mgc), Bachelor of Sortilege (B.S.), Bachelor of Magianism (B.Mn.), Bachelor of Divination (B.D.), and Bachelor of Civil Lore (B.C.L.). The easiest Baccalaureate to get is the Bachelor of Fluencing (B.F.) - the only degree that has made its way to Roundworlds. Other degrees like Bachelor of Amulets and Talismans (B.Am.Ta.), Bachelor of Cabalistic Rites (B.C.R.) and Bachelor of Impractical Necromancy (B.Im.N.) do not lead to a Master's degree. Master of Thaumatology (Master.Thau), Master of Magic (M.Mgc), Master of Sortilege (M.S.), Master of Magianism (M.Mn.), Master of Divination (M.D.), and Master of Civil Lore (M.C.L.). Master degrees give access to same named Doctorate studies. Besides the usual Doctorates, additionally one can achieve Doctor of Magical Philosophy (D.M.Phil.), Doctor of Morbid Spellbinding (D.M.S.), Doctor of Condensed Metaphysics (D.C.M.) and Doctor of Gramarye (D.G.). Register me with the UU! Alternatively, go to one of the academies or classrooms (course or academy registrations required), do some lab work (lab registrations required), climb over the wall and play a game in an inn (no registration required), and likely we'll meet somewhere, sometime in LSpace, or on Discworld.",
